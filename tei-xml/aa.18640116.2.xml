            <head type="main" subtype="authorial" rend="center">JOHN BROWN'S<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Determined to make war on Southern slavery, militant abolitionist John Brown (1800&#8211;1859) organized and led a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia (October 16&#8211;18, 1859), with a view to sparking slave uprisings throughout the South. In the years before the attack, Brown played a significant part in the deadly raids and reprisals that made Kansas Territory "bleed" as proslavery and free soil factions fought to define the identity of the state-to-be. (Brown's settler sons called for means to protect themselves from proslavery Missourians; when Brown took weapons west, he found a sense of divine purpose.) In 1858 he developed the Harpers Ferry plan with the covert assistance of a group of Northern abolitionists known as the "Secret Six."</p>
                <p>On October 16, 1859, Brown and his band of twenty-one volunteers succeeded in seizing the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, but the raid was quashed after a brief, intense fight between raiders and the militia. Slaves did not flock to Brown's side as he had hoped. After his capture, he was imprisoned and then tried at Charles Town. Initially he dismissed these legal proceedings as a "mockery" (quoted by David S. Reynolds, <title level="m">John Brown, Abolitionist: The Man Who Killed Slavery, Sparked the American Civil War, and Seeded Civil Rights</title> [New York: Knopf, 2005], 348). His words and bearing during his last days made an enormous impact on public opinion in the North and South. In the words of historian David Reynolds, "[t]he raid did not cause the storm. John Brown and the reaction to him did" (309). As a result of Brown's extraordinary performance, Northerners "began to see in Brown a hero" (357). Brown was sentenced to death on November 2; six days later, in a lecture delivered on November 8, 1859, Ralph Waldo Emerson declared that Brown would "make the gallows glorious like the cross" (366). Brown's execution on December 2, 1859, confirmed his martyrdom. Once war broke out in 1861, the song "John Brown's Body" "quickly became a Union favorite" (Franny Nudelman, <title level="m">John Brown's Body: Slavery, Violence, and the Culture of War</title> [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004], 14).</p></note> VISION OF THE FUTURE.</head>
            
            <note type="authorial">This is being represented on canvas by a lady artist in <lb/>Brooklyn.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>The artist was "Miss Hoyt of Brooklyn" (identified in the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> of February 20, 1864). According to an unidentified <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> correspondent, Hoyt designed the painting for the Ladies' National Union Fair&#8212;a fundraising event in aid of freedpeople and soldiers, held at the Academy of Music in Brooklyn, February 8&#8211;9, 1864. Although the fair was declared "a decided success," Hoyt's painting was not sold. As a result, "Justice" offered a suggestion in the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> of February 27:</p>
                
                <p>"Mr. Editor&#8212;In your number for Jan. 16, 1864, you published a poem entitled 'John  Brown's Vision of the Future,' which was said to be in the course of representation, on canvass, by a lady artist. If you have seen the painting I need not say to you it is almost a <emph rend="italic">chef d'ouvre</emph>&#8212;a triumph of American art. Competent judges valued it at $150 to $200. The managers of the Freedmen's Fair . . . did not succeed, for want either of time or energy in making a sale. But since the Fair, they, or one of the managers, has claimed the picture at $30. Now, Mr. Editor, as this lady artist is the only one to my knowledge, who has dared to place the emancipation before the artist world, by representations of the colored race, is it not important that some other reward than the above should be meted out?'" ([1])</p>
                
                <p>The columns of the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> give no clue as to whether the suggestion was taken up.</p></note></note>

War began when Confederates bombarded Sumter's federal garrison (April 12&#8211;13, 1861); as a result, the fort acquired special symbolic significance for both sides (E. Milby Burton, <title level="m">The Siege of Charleston, 1861&#8211;1865</title> [Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1970], 184). Union forces attacked Sumter several times during the war, as part of an ongoing attempt to capture Charleston. One enormous bombardment continued from late October until early December 1863.</note> upreared</l>
