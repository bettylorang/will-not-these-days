His poems appeared in the antislavery press during this period; Oliver Johnson, wartime editor of the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, published <title level="m">The Anti-Slavery Poems of John Pierpont</title> in 1843.</p><p>Pierpont moved to the First Unitarian Church of Troy, in New York, then settled at the First Congregational (Unitarian) Church of West Medford, Massachusetts (1849&#8211;1858). He supported the Liberty, Free Soil, and Republican parties (Reinhard O. Johnson, <title level="m">The Liberty Party, 1840&#8211;1848: Antislavery Third-Party Politics in the United States</title> [Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2009], 365). The outbreak of Civil War prompted him to enlist as a chaplain for the Twenty-Second Massachusetts Volunteers, but poor health forced the seventy-six year-old to give up the post after less than a month. "Our Country's Call" suggests that he continued to champion the war effort as a Union League member. He worked as a treasury clerk in Washington, DC from 1861 until his death.</p></note></byline>

The revolutionary lyrics (set to the older Scots tune "Hey tutti taitie") take the form of a rousing speech by Robert Bruce, who rallies his army to fight for freedom against England's King Edward II at Bannockburn: "Tyrants fall in every foe! / Liberty's in every blow!&#8212; / Let us do, or die!" (Robert Burn, <title level="m">Selected Poems</title>, ed. Carol McGuirk [London: Penguin, 1993], 178).</note></note>

                    <l>Men who plough your granite peaks,<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">Pierpont addresses New Hampshire men. Although the exact date of the poem's composition is unknown, Pierpont's targeted address may have been motivated by several political factors. The number of votes cast for the Democratic Party candidate in New Hampshire's gubernatorial election of March 1863 alarmed Republicans in New Hampshire and Washington, DC (Duane E. Shaffer, <title level="m">Men of Granite: New Hampshire's Soldiers in the Civil War</title> [Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2008], 135). The enactment of the Enrollment Act that same month (March 3, 1863) and, later, the Union army's crushing defeat at Chancellorsville (May 2&#8211;6, 1863) were further blows to morale. The Union League convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in mid-May 1863 may also have prompted Pierpont's call. Union Leagues were clubs formed to promote loyalty to the Union, with a more or less explicit Republican agenda, in towns and cities across the North. They spread during 1862&#8211;63 in response to perceived threats on the home front&#8212;namely, the plans of Confederate sympathizers and Peace Democrat propaganda. The Ohio convention aimed to coordinate their efforts more effectively.</note></l>

As the commander of the Army of the Potomac, cautious McClellan frustrated Lincoln by missing valuable opportunities to defeat Confederate general Robert E. Lee's army. Suspicious of McClellan's Democrat allegiance and proslavery stance, Republican politicians began to question his loyalty. When McClellan allowed Lee to slip out of the Shenandoah Valley after the Battle of Antietam (September 17, 1862), Lincoln removed him from his army command. McClellan went on to run against Lincoln as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in 1864.</note></l>

When he surveyed their abandoned fortifications, he found "logs painted black, soon to be notorious as 'Quaker guns'" (Stephen W. Sears, <title level="m">George B. McClellan: The Young Napoleon</title> [New York: Da Capo Press, 1999], 164). Press correspondents reported the ruse. Pierpont presents McClellan as a ridiculously timid "Napoleon."</note></l>

Jackson commanded the left wing (later the Second Corps) of the Army of Northern Virginia, while Stuart led the Cavalry Division. Both men led troops during General Robert E.

He was at the height of his fame when Pierpont's poem appeared in the <title level="j">Standard</title>. So, too, was Stonewall Jackson; by the end of 1862, the committed Presbyterian had already attained mythic status. He was shot by his own pickets as he returned to his lines during the Battle of Chancellorsville and died on May 10, 1863.</p></note></l>
