The choice of "Abraam" for Lincoln's name here has several possible implications. In the Old Testament, Abraham is first known as "Abram." In Genesis 17, God appears to Abram, then ninety-nine years old, saying, "You will be the father of many nations. No longer will you be called Abram [exalted father]; your name will be Abraham [father of many], for I have made you a father of many nations" (Gen. 17:4&#8211;5). The choice of "Abraam" over "Abraham" in the poem, then, may be a political statement regarding Lincoln. The name "Abraam" is also markedly more formal than the language of the rest of the poem, and the juxtaposition of the formal with the colloquial contributes to the humorous effect of the lines. Another possibility is that the use of "Abraam" over "Abraham" was done to achieve the desired meter.</note> lolled in his library chair,</l>

The original <title level="m">Joe Miller's Jests</title> was reissued as a facsimile copy by London publisher John Camden Hotten in 1862.</note> and "Vanity Fair,"<note type="editorial"><title level="j">Vanity Fair</title> was a humor paper established in the 1850s, with roots in New York City's Bohemian crowd. The first issue of the weekly was that of December 31, 1859; the last issue had appeared nearly a year before the publication of "Abraam and Columbia" in the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, on July 4, 1863.

In his reply to the delegation from the National Union League, dated June 9, 1864, Lincoln wrote, "I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to conclude that I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded, in this connection, of a story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion once that 'it was not best to swap horses when crossing streams.'" Lincoln's letter was reprinted in three major New York papers&#8212;the <title level="j">Times</title>, <title level="j">Herald</title>, and <title level="j">Tribune</title>&#8212;on June 10, 1864.

McClellan (1826&#8211;1885). The flattering reference to McClellan is particularly important, as the poem appeared weeks before he secured the Democratic Party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. "Abraam and Columbia" is a piece of Democrat propaganda; this context explains why the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> published the piece in its front-page "Pro-Slavery" column.</note></l>
