                <epigraph><ab>"When the Cumberland was sunk, the sword of Capt. <lb/>Morris was saved by his negro servant boy at the risk of <lb/>his life."</ab><note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Lieutenant George Upham Morris (1830&#8211;1875), acting commander of the USS <name type="ship">Cumberland</name> on March 8, 1862, when the Confederate ironclad steamer <name type="ship">Virginia</name> (known to Northerners as the <name type="ship">Merrimack</name>) attacked US Navy vessels in the blockade at Hampton Roads, Virginia. The wooden fleet was no match for the ironclad; the battle showed that modern technologies had rendered antebellum navies obsolete.</p><p>The <name type="ship">Cumberland</name> was the first of the <name type="ship">Virginia</name>'s targets. Morris described the encounter in his official report: "We opened fire on her. She stood on and struck us under the starboard fore channels. She delivered her fire at the same time. The destruction was great. We returned the fire with solid shot with alacrity" ("Lieutenant Morris's Report," in <title level="m">The Rebellion Record: A Diary of American Events</title>, ed. Frank Moore [New York: Putnam, 1862], 4:269). At 3:35 p.m., just over two and a half hours after the ironclad "hove in sight," the <name type="ship">Cumberland</name>'s crew "delivered a parting fire" and abandoned the sinking ship, "each man trying to save himself by jumping overboard" (269). The <name type="ship">Cumberland</name> sank with her flag flying. The <name type="ship">Virginia</name> then turned to the <name type="ship">Congress</name>; the wooden frigate exploded when fires reached her magazine.</p><p>The first day of the battle of Hampton Roads was "the worst in the eighty-six-year history of the U.S. navy" (James M. McPherson, <title level="m">Battle Cry of Freedom: The American Civil War</title> [London: Penguin, 1991], 376). The destruction would have continued on March 9, if the Union ironclad <name type="ship">Monitor</name> had not arrived to tackle the <name type="ship">Virginia</name>. Both crews thought they had won the battle that ensued. Morris and the survivors from the <name type="ship">Cumberland</name> and <name type="ship">Congress</name> were welcomed as heroes in New York City on April 10. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and George H. Boker were among those who responded to the battle in verse. A narrative similar to that in "The Black Hero of the Cumberland" appears in Boker's "The Sword-Bearer" (later published in Frank Moore, ed., <title level="m">The Rebellion Record</title> [New York: Putnam, 1862], 4:91&#8211;92).</p><p>The source of Backus's epigraph has not been identified. It was probably taken from newspaper correspondence. The battle of Hampton Roads was widely reported in the press; Americans were hungry for war news, and public interest in triumphant ironclad technology ran high. Backus hints at the extent of the coverage in stanza 6: her speaker addresses an audience who have "read the thrilling story" of the <name type="ship">Cumberland</name>'s resistance and destruction.</p></note></epigraph>
