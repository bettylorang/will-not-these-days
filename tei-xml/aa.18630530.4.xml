                <byline rend="center">BY A. P. SMITH.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Alfred P. Smith (1832&#8211;1901), journalist and editor. Born in Saddle River, New Jersey, the son of day laborer and farmer Peter, Alfred Smith received a public school education (David Steven Cohen, "Alfred P. Smith: Bergen County's Latter-Day Ben Franklin," <title level="j">Journal of Rutgers University Libraries</title> 38 [1977]: 23&#8211;24). In the winter of 1858&#8211;59, Smith petitioned New Jersey's state legislature to "take the initiatory steps to give colored persons the right of suffrage" (<title level="m">Minutes of Votes and Proceedings of the Eighty-Third General Assembly of the State of New Jersey, Convened at Trenton, Jan. 11, 1859</title> [Salem, NJ: Sharp, 1859], 388). During the war years, he contributed letters to the <title level="j">Paterson Daily Guardian</title>. The <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> printed a cluster of poems attributed to Smith over a seven-month period in 1863: "A Tribute: In Memory of Edward M. Thomas" (April 18, 1863); "The Patriot's Vow" (May 16, 1863); "The Fast God Hath Appointed" (May 30, 1863); <ref target="aa.18630808.4b">"The Louisiana Native Guard at Port Hudson"</ref> (August 8, 1863); "To A Young Friend" (August 15, 1863); and <ref target="aa.18631010.4">"A War Song for the Black Volunteers"</ref> (October 10, 1863). Smith's <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> verse expresses his strong support for African American soldiers. Earlier in the war, he took a public stand against colonization schemes (see "Letter to the President," <title level="j">Paterson Daily Guardian</title>, reprinted in <title level="j">Douglass' Monthly</title>, October 1862, [730&#8211;31].</p><p>According to T. Robins Brown and Schuyler Warmflash, from 1876 until his death, Smith took care of his widowed mother and largely stayed at home, because of "increased disability" (<title level="m">The Architecture of Bergen County, New Jersey: The Colonial Period to the Twentieth Century</title> [New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2001], 170). At home, however, he worked a press and established <title level="j">A. P. Smith's Paper</title> in 1881. The title, reminiscent of <title level="j">Frederick Douglass' Paper</title>, did not last long; Smith renamed his publication <title level="j">The Landscape: A Country Newspaper</title> in 1882. The monthly ran until July 1901.</p></note></byline>

                <dateline><emph rend="italic">Saddle River, New Jersey, April 30th,</emph> 1863.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Smith's poem is dated "April 30th, 1863." When Abraham Lincoln proclaimed April 30, 1863, as a "day of national humiliation, fasting and prayer," he encouraged Northerners to seek forgiveness for "national sins" in the hope of securing God's "clemency" (Roy P. Basler, ed., <title level="m">The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</title> [New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953], 6:156). This fast was the second of three national fasts which Lincoln declared during the war (September 26, 1861; April 30, 1863; August 4, 1864).</p><p>Lincoln's proclamations were supported by the weight of tradition: in the North, the public fast was "the resort of instinctive choice" when disaster struck (Harry S. Stout and Christopher Grasso, "Civil War, Religion, and Communications: The Case of Richmond," in <title level="m">Religion and the American Civil War</title>, ed. Randall M. Miller, et al. [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998], 320). Of the fast on April 30, the <title level="j">New York Herald</title> reported that "no previous occasion of the kind, within the memory of the present generation, was ever kept with such general accord." Public offices and private businesses were alike suspended. In the great city, "courts, post offices, custom House, mercantile exchanges, banks and all other similar places were completely closed"&#8212;so too were "stores and factories." "The religious services were the great feature of the day" (<title level="j">New York Herald</title>, May 1, 1863, [1]).</p><p>Not everyone was convinced of the value of such rituals and ceremonies. In "The Fast God Hath Appointed," Smith argued that Americans had to do more than observe the mere forms of a fast to secure God's blessing&#8212;Isaiah 58:6 ("let the oppressed go free") demanded nothing less than the abolition of slavery throughout the United States. Soon after the fast of August 1864, one of the <title level="j">Liberator</title>'s correspondents reiterated Smith's argument in prose. The government had no right to plead for divine aid while it refused to make a "perfect and effective" alliance with African Americans on the basis of  "citizenship and equality before the law." C. K. W. concluded that "this Fast, like all the ceremonies of humiliation performed by our oppressive nation, is the offering to God of a complimentary formality <emph rend="italic">in place of the discharge of that duty which we know to be incumbent on us</emph>. Surely this is not the fast that He has chosen" (<title level="j">Liberator</title>, August 19, 1864).</p></note></dateline>
