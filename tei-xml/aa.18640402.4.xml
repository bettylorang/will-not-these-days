                <byline rend="center">BY B. CLARK, SEN.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Benjamin Clark, Senior (1801&#8211;1864), born in Maryland. He described himself as the son "of parents, on the one side, who, like many others, had the good fortune to become emancipated after more than thirty years of unrequited toil" (B. Clark, Sen., <title level="m">The Past, Present and Future in Poetry and Prose</title> [Toronto: Adam, Stevenson and Co., 1867], 7). At some point before 1831, Clark and his wife, Caroline, moved north to Pennsylvania with their two sons. Census records for 1850 place the Clark family in York, Pennsylvania. Benjamin and Caroline lived with ten children aged one through twenty-four. Their eldest boys had established trades&#8212;one a tailor, another a shoemaker. Clark himself was a successful "blue dyer," with real estate worth $1,000. He was troubled by his lungs, perhaps as a result of a life in dye works. In 1861 he moved to Detroit City, Michigan, to recover his health. He died there on February 10, 1864; an <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> obituary of March 12, 1864, describes him as a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and a temperance advocate.</p><p>Throughout his life, Clark wrote occasional verse on political, religious, and domestic subjects. Several pieces attributed to "B. Clark, SEN" appeared in <title level="j">Frederick Douglass' Paper</title> and the <title level="j">Weekly Anglo-African</title>. These and other poems were published in a collection of his writing, <title level="m">The Past, Present and Future in Prose and Poetry</title> (1867). "Be Joyful!," one of Clark's last poems, is the final piece in the book. Before he died, he outlined his aims and assumed a posture of humility in introductory paragraphs headed "Autobiography": "an earnest desire to assist in swelling the tide of righteous indignation against a system of oppression and wrong inflicted upon a helpless and inoffensive portion of his brethren, is his only apology for appearing before the public" (8).</p></note></byline>

Barns was instrumental in the formation of Michigan's First African American regiment. After making numerous appeals, he received authorization to raise a black regiment on August 12, 1863. He conducted a vigorous recruitment campaign, in spite of Copperhead opposition. By the end of March 1864, the regiment was full and ready to leave Camp Ward. Orders were received on March 25; the regiment left three days later, on March 28, with Barns as its colonel (a post he gave up to a man better qualified some days later). Before its departure, the regiment "halted on Jefferson avenue to give friends and relatives an opportunity to bid the brave boys good-bye" (<title level="j">Advertiser</title>, March 28, 1864). Clark may well have written "Be Joyful!" in response to the regiment's preparations for departure&#8212;which he may have witnessed firsthand or read about in the columns of Detroit papers like the <title level="j">Tribune and Advertiser</title>. Barns's name does not appear in the later book version of the poem.</note></l>
