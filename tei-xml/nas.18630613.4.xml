            <byline rend="right"><emph rend="smallcaps">MARY CLEMMER AMES.</emph><note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Born in New York, Mary Clemmer (1831?&#8211;1884) moved with her family to Massachusetts in 1847. She attended Westfield Academy before her family's state of financial crisis pushed her into an early marriage with the Reverend Daniel Ames. "All that was spiritually right in this relation, called a marriage," an early biographer wrote, "was its final legal annulment" ("Miss Whiting," quoted by Edmund Hudson, <title level="m">An American Woman's Life and Work: A Memorial of Mary Clemmer</title> [Boston: Ticknor, 1886], 42). In the 1850s her husband moved several times from state to state. Clemmer lived for a period in New York, and began to contribute letters to the <title level="j">Utica Morning Herald</title> and Samuel Bowles's <title level="j">Springfield Republican</title>&#8212;probably with a view to securing financial independence. During the same period, her friendship with celebrated poet sisters Alice and Phoebe Cary allowed her to develop a network of literary associations.</p><p>Before the outbreak of war, Clemmer joined Ames in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, where he was working as a government storekeeper. She was still there when Confederates captured the town in 1862. After a brief spell as a prisoner of war, she turned to nursing and writing in Washington, DC. Her first novel, <title level="m">Victoire</title>, was published in 1864. The following year, she separated from Ames (they would divorce in 1874). The New York <title level="j">Independent</title> published the first of Clemmer's famous Washington letters in March 1866; in the same year, she was able to "[undertake] the entire support of herself and her father and mother" (43). Clemmer's letters concentrated on political news and social issues instead of "society" comings and goings. Her column lasted for more than twenty years.</p></note></byline>
            <note type="newspaper-editorial">&#8212;<title level="j" rend="italic">Springfield Republican</title>.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">Samuel Bowles, III (1826&#8211;1878) founded the <title level="j">Daily Republican</title> in 1844, having worked with his father on the <title level="j">Weekly Republican</title> (est. 1824). Antislavery Whig Bowles opposed disunion and the extension of slavery, but he had little sympathy with Garrisonian abolitionists or their concept of a "higher law." Provoked by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, however, he attacked the Fugitive Slave Law and called for slavery's opponents to form a political union (George S. Merriam, <title level="m">Life and Times of Samuel Bowles</title> [New York: The Century Co., 1885], 1:121). Bowles threw his support behind the Republican Party. His paper "not only upheld without faltering the Union and the war; it supported with equal steadiness the government of President Lincoln" (349).
