By the time war broke out, he had established a formidable reputation as a travel writer, lecturer, and poet. He had also been appointed manager of the <title level="j">New York Tribune</title>'s Literary Department. He served as the <title level="j">Tribune</title>'s Washington "special" until May 1862, when he accepted a diplomatic post as secretary (then charge d'affaires) to the American Legation at St. Petersburg, Russia. For over a year, he monitored and managed Russian reactions to the progress of the American Civil War.</p><p>In the winter of 1862, he helped to ensure that the emperor resisted Anglo-French pressure to intervene in war. Although Lincoln did not give him the diplomatic post he desired, Taylor reported himself well satisfied that he had "done real service to the country" (<title level="m">Selected Letters of Bayard Taylor</title>, ed. Paul C. Wermuth [Cranbury, NJ: Bucknell University Press, 1997], 199). Shortly before he began his journey back to America, he learned that his brother had been killed at Gettysburg. He returned to Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, with his family in the autumn of 1863. During the rest of the war, Taylor worked the lyceum circuit with material from his Russian sojourn, and wrote and published his first two novels, <title level="m">Hannah Thurston</title> (1863) and <title level="m">John Godfrey's Fortunes</title> (1864). See also Cary Wolfe, "Taylor, Bayard," in <title level="m">American National Biography Online</title>.</p><p>"A Thousand Years" first appeared in the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> issue dated November 1, 1862. The poem's reappearance in late September 1863, almost a year after Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, was doubly timely; Taylor's poem at once served as a commentary on America's progress toward the abolition of slavery and fed popular interest in newly arrived Russian sailors. "A Russian Fleet Coming into Our Harbor," announced the <title level="j">New York Times</title> on September 24, 1863: "The Russian frigate <name type="ship">Osliaba</name>, which has lain at anchor in our harbor for several days past, and has been an object of so much interest to our citizens, is about to be reinforced by a fleet of four or five vessels of the same nationality" ([2]). The visitors were welcomed warmly. The American public, however, was unaware that the emperor had sent the squadron to a friendly port so that if war broke out with France and Britain as a result of his brutal policies in Poland, Russian ships would not be blockaded.</p></note></byline>
