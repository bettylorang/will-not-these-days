Jackson.</emph><note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Fanny Marion Jackson Coppin (1837&#8211;1913), born into slavery in the District of Columbia and emancipated by an aunt before her tenth birthday. She moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, and then to Newport, Rhode Island, where she combined domestic work with study in order to enter the Rhode Island State Normal School. During the Civil War years, Jackson attended Oberlin College, "then the only College in the United States where colored students were permitted to study" (Fanny Jackson-Coppin, <title level="m">Reminiscences of School Life, and Hints on Teaching</title> [Philadelphia: A. M. E. Book Concern, 1913], 12).</p><p>At Oberlin, Jackson took "the gentleman's course" with "plenty of Latin and Greek in it, and as much mathematics as one could shoulder" (12). She distinguished herself as an exceptional scholar. "I never rose to recite in my classes at Oberlin but I felt that I had the honor of the whole African race upon my shoulders," she recalled in <title level="m">Reminiscences of School Life, and Hints on Teaching</title> (15). The faculty recognized her academic achievements when they gave her preparatory classes to teach in her junior year. During her time at Oberlin, she also led evening classes for freedpeople and raised funds for African American soldiers. At the same time, she supported the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> with occasional contributions, and collected funds to send copies of the newspaper to soldiers. At the same time, she supported the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, collecting funds to send copies of the newspapers to soldiers and assisting in the organization of a "National Fair" in aid of the paper (<title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, June 4, 1864, [2]; January 21, 1865, [3]).</p><p>After graduation, Jackson began her career as a teacher at Philadelphia's Institute for Colored Youth. In 1869 Jackson was appointed as principal of the whole school; the promotion broke new ground, as "no woman at this time headed a coeducational institution that had both male and female faculty" (Linda M. Perkins, "Coppin, Fanny Jackson," in <title level="m">American National Biography Online</title>). She continued her pioneering work as an educator after marrying minister Levi Jenkins Coppin in 1881. Like Coppin, Jackson was a dedicated member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1878 she established a "Women's Department" in the <title level="j">Christian Recorder</title>. For more on Jackson's life and work, see Linda M. Perkins's biography, <title level="m">Fanny Jackson Coppin and the Institute for Colored Youth, 1865&#8211;1902</title> (London: Garland, 1987).</p></note></byline>
