His military successes culminated in the conquest of Naples and Sicily (1860). Garibaldi's fight for Italian unification and independence earned him an international reputation. According to Dennis Berthold, "The American press eagerly shaped Garibaldi's legend to fit the contours of national ideology" ("Melville, Garibaldi, and the Medusa of Revolution," in <title level="m">National Imaginaries, American Identities: The Cultural Work of American Iconography</title>, ed. Larry J. Reynolds and Gordon Hutner [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000], 110). In June 1861 Abraham Lincoln offered him a command in the Union Army, but Garibaldi did not accept the appointment, apparently because Lincoln would not agree to immediate emancipation for all slaves; even so, "his name became indelibly associated with the Union cause" (Berthold, 113).</p><p>Garibaldi received a hero's welcome when he came to England in April 1864. The <title level="j">New York Times</title> of May 8, 1864, reported that 600,000 people had greeted the "Italian Liberator" in London. During the same trip, Garibaldi visited Tennyson and his family at their home on the Isle of Wight. Hallam Tennyson recalled that his father "was always an enthusiast for Italian freedom" (<title level="m">Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir, by His Son</title> [London: Macmillan, 1897], 2:1). After the visit, Tennyson described his impressions to the Duke of Argyll: "What a noble human being! I expected to see a hero and I was not disappointed. One cannot exactly say of him what Chaucer says of the ideal knight, 'As meke he was of port as is a maid'; he is more majestic than meek, and his manners have a certain divine simplicity in them" (3).</p></note></head>
