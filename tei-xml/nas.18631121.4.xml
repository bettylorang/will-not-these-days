McKee (1832&#8211;1868), Presbyterian minister and missionary. At about fourteen, McKee left Ireland for the United States (Rev. James M'Neal, "Biographical Sketch of Rev. Jos. G. McKee," in <title level="m">A History of the Colored Schools of Nashville, Tennessee</title>, comp. G. W. Hubbard [Nashville, TN: Wheeler, 1874], 31). He attended Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, and joined the ministry of the United Presbyterian Church on completing his theological training. Thereafter he worked as a missionary in Nebraska (31). He had been preparing himself to join his uncle's mission in India when the Second Synod of the West chose him to led their first mission among the freedpeople of Nashville, Tennessee (Rev. J. W. Wait, "The United Presbyterian Mission among the Freedmen in Nashville," in Hubbard, <title level="m">A History of the Colored Schools of Nashville</title>, 7).</p><p>McKee arrived in Nashville in late September 1863; on October 13 he opened a large missionary school for freedpeople in the city's northwest Baptist Church. In the winter of 1863&#8211;64, "the suffering [of the freedpeople] was so great the teachers' time was employed in giving relief, distributing food, clothing, fuel, obtaining homes for the houseless, etc." (7). McKee's health broke down, forcing him to return north in March 1864. He rejoined the mission in late December. For nearly four years, McKee dedicated himself to subsequent Presbyterian missions in Nashville, in spite of poor health, which continued to limit his activities. In 1865 the McKee School was built with funds he had raised in the North. Illness forced him to resign his post as superintendent of the mission in the summer of 1868, and he died on September 25.</p></note></byline>
