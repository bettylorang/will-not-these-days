                <head type="main" subtype="authorial" rend="center">TO ROBERT GOULD SHAW,<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Robert Gould Shaw (1837&#8211;July 18, 1863) was colonel of the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Regiment, the first regiment of African American volunteers raised in the North, authorized in late January 1863 and mustered into the US service on May 13. Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts received War Department authorization to raise the first Northern regiment of African American volunteers in January 1863. Determined to form a model regiment, Andrew took care to select advisers, officers, and recruiters with antislavery convictions or connections; he offered Shaw the regiment's colonelcy at the end of January, on the basis of the young captain's military record and his wealthy family's influence in reform circles. Shaw turned Andrew down; he did not have abolitionist principles to trump his strong attachment to the Second Massachusetts Infantry. His mother persuaded him to think again.</p>
                    <p>Black leaders called on men to enlist and thereby seize their "golden opportunity" and "first best chance" to establish an undeniable claim to the full rights of American citizens (Frederick Douglass, "Men of Color, to Arms!" reprinted in the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, March 7, 1863, [2]; editorial, <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, March 7, 1863, [2]). The Fifty-Fourth quickly filled with men "from virtually every black community in the North" (Donald Yacovone, <title level="m">A Voice of Thunder: A Black Soldier's Civil War</title> [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1998], 31). A number of the new recruits would provide the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> and the <title level="j">Christian Recorder</title> with correspondence from the front during their term of service. Both titles served as a channel of communication between distant volunteers and the folks at home.</p>
                    <p>Under Shaw's command, the regiment took shape at Camp Meigs in Readville, Massachusetts. On May, 28, 1863, after weeks of training, the men paraded through Boston's cheering streets and then embarked on the steamer <name type="ship">De Molay</name>, bound for South Carolina's Sea Islands and the theater of war. On July 18, 1863, Shaw and the Fifty-Fourth courageously led a frontal attack on Morris Island's (South Carolina) Fort Wagner. Their bravery could not compensate for General Quincy Gillmore's poor planning; the assault failed, and 272 members of the regiment were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner (Russell Duncan, ed., <title level="m">Blue-Eyed Child of Fortune: The Civil War Letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw</title> [Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1999], 52). Northern newspapers reported that Fort Wagner's Confederate garrison had buried Shaw in a mass grave with his men. Abolitionists reinterpreted the Confederate gesture of contempt as a mark of distinction. Shaw's parents made known their wish that his body should not be disturbed: "We would not have his body removed from where it lies surrounded by his brave &#38; devoted soldiers, if we could accomplish it by a word" (letter dated August 3, 1863, quoted in Duncan, 54).</p></note></head>

            <note type="newspaper-editorial">&#8212;<title level="j">Evening Post</title>.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>The <title level="j">New York Evening Post</title>, founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1801. William Cullen Bryant (1794&#8211;1878) began to write for the title in 1826, having struggled to make a living as a poet; by 1830 he was the <title level="j">Post</title>'s editor-in-chief, and the daily's financial prospects looked good (Allan Nevins, <title level="m">The Evening Post: A Century of Journalism</title> [New York: Russell and Russell, 1968], 134-136). Committed to Free Soil principles, Bryant severed the <title level="j">Post</title>'s connection with the Democratic Party in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) and backed the fledgling Republican Party in 1856. He threw his weight behind Lincoln's presidential campaign in 1860. Although the <title level="j">Post</title> remained staunchly Republican throughout the war, Bryant did not shrink from criticizing Lincoln's policies. The <title level="j">Post</title> "shared with the <title level="j">Tribune</title> the advocacy of what came to be called the 'radical' Republican doctrines during the Civil War&#8212;namely, emancipation, the need of strong and swift military measures, and the removal of pro-slavery and Democratic leaders from the government and army" (Frank Luther Mott, <title level="m">American Journalism: A History of Newspapers in the United States Through Twenty Years, 1690&#8211;1940</title> [New York: Macmillan, 1941], 5:344).</p><p>The <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> complimented and criticized the <title level="j">Post</title> in its issue of October 3, 1863. It "never, like the <title level="j">Tribune</title>, [got] the 'stericks,' no matter what the case may be," but it was not "a safe guide in all things." "In its heart of hearts it does not recognize God's black man as a man and a brother&#8212;intellectually perhaps it does, but morally and socially, it does not. Hence while it hates slavery, it covets slave territory for free white labor, with a 'scourging' out of the 'inferior race' into some part of the tropical region belonging to nobody; it meanly 'begrudged' Florida to the free blacks." As a result, the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>'s "great neighbor" made arguments "of which he ought to be ashamed." The editor cited the <title level="j">Post</title>'s assertion that African American soldiers were due the same protections but not the same "honors and emoluments" as white soldiers. As far as the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> was concerned, "[the government] cannot treat the black soldier as an inferior and ask the Confederates to treat him as an equal" ([3]).</p></note></note>
