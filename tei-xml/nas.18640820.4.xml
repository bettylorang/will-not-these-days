Blake was an engraver, visionary artist, and poet.</p><p>"The Little Black Boy" first appeared in Blake's 1789 illuminated book, <title level="m">Songs of Innocence</title>, produced in a very limited run. The poem was available to a wide audience for the first time in 1839, twelve years after Blake's death, with the first commercial edition of <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and Experience</title>. According to Marcus Wood, "The Little Black Boy" appeared in the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> for the first time in 1842, along with other selections from <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and Experience</title> (Marcus Wood, ed., <title level="m">The Poetry of Slavery: An Anglo-American Anthology, 1764&#8211;1865</title> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003], 142). The poem was included in Alexander Gilchrist's <title level="m">Life of William Blake, "Pictor Ignotus,"</title> a work that renewed interest in Blake in 1863. (Gilchrist's <title level="m">Life of William Blake</title> was published posthumously in two volumes under the direction of his wife, Anne Gilchrist, and with the assistance of William Michael Rossetti and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.)</p></note></head>

William Cullen Bryant (1794&#8211;1878) began to write for the title in 1826, having struggled to make a living as a poet; by 1830 he was the <title level="j">Post</title>'s editor-in-chief, and the daily's financial prospects looked good (Allan Nevins, <title level="m">The Evening Post: A Century of Journalism</title> [New York: Russell and Russell, 1968], 134-136). Committed to Free Soil principles, Bryant severed the <title level="j">Post</title>'s connection with the Democratic Party in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) and backed the fledgling Republican Party in 1856. He threw his weight behind Lincoln's presidential campaign in 1860. Although the <title level="j">Post</title> remained staunchly Republican throughout the war, Bryant did not shrink from criticizing Lincoln's policies. The <title level="j">Post</title> "shared with the <title level="j">Tribune</title> the advocacy of what came to be called the 'radical' Republican doctrines during the Civil War&#8212;namely, emancipation, the need of strong and swift military measures, and the removal of pro-slavery and Democratic leaders from the government and army" (Frank Luther Mott, <title level="m">American Journalism: A History of Newspapers in the United States Through Twenty Years, 1690&#8211;1940</title> [New York: Macmillan, 1941], 5:344).</p></note></salute>
