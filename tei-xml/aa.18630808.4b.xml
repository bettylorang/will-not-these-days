Some newspaper correspondents mistakenly reported that it was the Second Regiment which had taken part in the assault. In the summer of 1863 Boker's poem circulated in the antislavery press under the title "The Second Louisiana" (see also "The Second Louisiana" in the <title level="j">Christian Recorder</title>, June 13, 1863, and <ref target="aa.18630627.1">"The Second Louisiana"</ref> in the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, June 27, 1863). Boker probably wrote the poem in response to early reports, then changed the title to "The Black Regiment" when the mistake became apparent.</p><p>"Col. Daniel's Second Louisiana negro regiment distinguished itself . . . especially in charging upon the enemy's siege guns, losing killed and wounded over 600," reported the <title level="j">Boston Daily Evening Transcript</title> of June 6, 1863 (quoted by James G. Hollandsworth, <title level="m">The Louisiana Native Guards: The Black Military Experience during the Civil War</title> [Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1995], 63). "Nobly done, Second Regiment of Louisiana," proclaimed the <title level="j">Liberator</title> a fortnight later. General Nathaniel Banks's official report praised the First and Third Regiments. The <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> of June 13, 1863, brushed aside reporters' confusion as to which Louisiana regiments had taken part in the battle: "It is immaterial which statement is true, so long as the great fact remains; <emph rend="italic">that no such fighting has been seen since the war began</emph>." Smith's precise footnote to "The Louisiana Native Guard at Port Hudson" implies a concern that the right soldiers be given their due.</p></note></head>

                <byline rend="center">BY A. P. SMITH.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Alfred P. Smith (1832&#8211;1901), journalist and editor. Born in Saddle River, New Jersey, the son of day laborer and farmer Peter Smith, Alfred P. Smith received a public school education (David Steven Cohen, "Alfred P. Smith: Bergen County's Latter-Day Ben Franklin," <title level="j">Journal of Rutgers University Libraries</title> 38 [1977]: 23&#8211;24). In the winter of 1858&#8211;59, Smith petitioned New Jersey's state legislature to "take the initiatory steps to give colored persons the right of suffrage" (<title level="m">Minutes of Votes and Proceedings of the Eighty-Third General Assembly of the State of New Jersey, Convened at Trenton, Jan. 11, 1859</title> [Salem, NJ: Sharp, 1859], 388). During the war years, he contributed letters to the <title level="j">Paterson Daily Guardian</title>. The <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> printed a cluster of poems attributed to Smith over a seven-month period in 1863: "A Tribute: In Memory of Edward M. Thomas" (April 18, 1863); "The Patriot's Vow" (May 16, 1863); "The Fast God Hath Appointed" (May 30, 1863); <ref target="aa.18630808.4b">"The Louisiana Native Guard at Port Hudson"</ref> (August 8, 1863); "To a Young Friend" (August 15, 1863); and <ref target="aa.18631010.4">"A War Song for the Black Volunteers"</ref> (October 10, 1863). Smith's <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> verse expresses his strong support for African American soldiers. Earlier in the war, he took a strong stand against colonization schemes (see "Letter to the President," <title level="j">Paterson Daily Guardian</title>, reprinted in <title level="j">Douglass' Monthly</title>, October 1862 [730&#8211;31].</p><p>According to T. Robins Brown and Schuyler Warmflash, from 1876 until his death, Smith took care of his widowed mother and largely stayed at home, because of "increased disability" (<title level="m">The Architecture of Bergen County, New Jersey: The Colonial Period to the Twentieth Century</title> [New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2001], 170). At home, however, he worked a press and established <title level="j">A. P. Smith's Paper</title> in 1881. The title, reminiscent of <title level="j">Frederick Douglass' Paper</title>, did not last long; Smith renamed his publication <title level="j">The Landscape: A Country Newspaper</title> in 1882. The monthly ran until July 1901.</p></note></byline>

He was a husband and a father and was well respected within his community. Smith may have drawn on reports that Cailloux "prided himself on his color" (<title level="j">Anglo-African</title>,  June 27, 1863, [2]; Stephen S. Ochs, <title level="m">A Black Patriot and a White Priest: Andr&#233; Cailloux and Claude Paschal Maistre in Civil War New Orleans</title> [Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2000], 9).</p><p>Cailloux was one of about a thousand free people of color who enlisted in the Native Guards Militia, before New Orleans fell to Union forces at the end of April 1862 (Ochs, 70). In response to General Benjamin Butler's summer call for Afro-Creole men to join Union regiments of Louisiana Native Guards, Cailloux helped to raise what would become Company E of the First Regiment of the Louisiana Native Guards. The regiment was mustered into service on September 27, 1862, with nineteen Afro-Creole line officers, Captain Cailloux among them.</p><p>The soldiers of Company E led the attack on Port Hudson (May 27, 1863), with Cailloux at their head. He was wounded and then killed during the regiment's charge. His bravery and leadership were praised in the Northern press, but Confederate soldiers or white Union commanders prevented Cailloux's comrades from recovering his body and the bodies of his men. The corpses lay on the battlefield until Port Hudson surrendered (Ochs, 148). Cailloux's remains were then brought back to New Orleans, where a grand public funeral was held on July 29. Huge crowds brought city streets to a standstill. Stephen Ochs describes Cailloux as "the first nationally publicized black warrior-hero of the Civil War" (156).</p></note></l>
