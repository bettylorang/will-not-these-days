Both the Free Mission Society (est. 1843) and the <title level="j">American Baptist</title> claimed to be "intensely abolitionist" (E. W. Brown, <title level="m">The Whole World Kin: A Pioneer Experience Among Remote Tribes, and Other Labors of Nathan Brown</title> [Philadelphia: Hubbard, 1890], 456). The <title level="j">National Era</title> of April 28, 1853, advertised the <title level="j">American Baptist</title> as "the only Baptist newspaper in the United States advocating the principle of non-fellowship with slaveholders, either in ecclesiastical or in voluntary missionary organizations" ([3]). The Reverend Wareham Walker served as the title's editor from 1852? to 1857. Nathan Brown, newly recovered from two decades of missionary work in Burma and Assam, took over the editorship and continued in the post until 1872.</p><p>Brown's wartime unionism was thoroughly informed by his conviction of national sin: "We look upon the union as one and indivisible; a nation raised up by Providence, and bound together in its material interests by the natural configuration of the country. We are also linked together in responsibility for the guilty system of slavery, and together we must work out the problem of its extinction" (editorial, November 1862, quoted in Brown, 462). In late December, on the eve of the Emancipation Proclamation, Brown accompanied George Cheever and William Goodell to the White House to present Lincoln with a memorial requesting a stronger statement against slavery (464). Brown rejoiced on finding that the final proclamation referred to emancipation as "an act of justice": "it writes the name of ABRAHAM LINCOLN among the stars" (474).</p></note></note>

C.,<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>A town at the juncture of the Tar and Pamlico Rivers, north of New Bern, North Carolina. Union troops under General Ambrose Burnside's command occupied Washington in March 1862, as part of a larger operation against important coastal locations. In March 1863 General Daniel Hill's Confederate forces attempted to retake Washington by breaking the garrison's supply lines; by the end of March, the Union garrison was effectively under siege (John G. Barrett, <title level="m">The Civil War in North Carolina</title> [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1963], 156). The stalemate was broken in mid-April, when the steamer <name type="ship">Escort</name> ran Confederate batteries to deliver reinforcements and supplies. The <name type="ship">Escort</name> left Washington with department commander John Forster, but the siege was abandoned before he could return with more men.</p><p>Like other occupied towns in the region, Washington attracted a population of former slaves from the surrounding areas. Vincent Colyer, former superintendent of the poor in the Department of North Carolina, estimated that there were 1,500 freedpeople at Washington, Hatteras, Carolina, and Beaufort in mid 1862 (<title level="m">Freedom: A Documentary History of Emancipation 1861&#8211;1867</title>, ed. Ira Berlin, et al. [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990], series 1, 2:123).</p></note> a flat <lb/>full of soldiers, with a few negroes, got aground <lb/>under rebel fire.

He then deliberately got <lb/>out and pushed the boat off, and fell into it, <lb/>pierced by five bullets.]</note>
