                <note type="newspaper-editorial"><p>[The following lines, entitled, "What of the Day?" were <lb/>sent to the Autograph Committee of the Great Western <lb/>Sanitary Fair,<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>The Great Western Sanitary Fair (December 21, 1863&#8211;January 9, 1864), one of the major fairs held in cities across the North and West, to raise funds for the relief work of the United States Sanitary Commission.</p><p>The United States Sanitary Commission was established under government authority on June 9, 1861. A vast multilevel civilian organization, it managed the systematic collection of supplies from local soldiers' aid societies and oversaw their effective distribution in Union camps and hospitals and on battlefields ([Charles Brandon Boynton?], <title level="m">History of the Great Western Sanitary Fair</title> [Cincinnati: Vent, 1864], xvi). The commission also supported the Medical Bureau with information and "modest counsel." So-called branches formed the vital link between the commission and hundreds of local societies in a particular region. At central depots, managers oversaw the collection of contributions in kind as well as the purchase of supplies with money from appeals and fairs, and forwarded stocks at the direction of the sanitary commission. Women played a crucial role in the relief effort at the grassroots and branch levels. (See Judith Ann Giesberg, <title level="m">Civil War Sisterhood: The U.S. Sanitary Commission and Women's Politics in Transition</title> [Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2000].)The Cincinnati Branch of the United States Sanitary Commission was organized in November 1861. Its accounts up to August 11, 1864, show total receipts of just over $313,920, of which the Great Fair raised more than $235,400 ([Boynton?], xxx).</p><p>The fair itself was the result of collaboration between members of the Cincinnati Branch and the city's National Union Association. Planning began in November 1863; no less than sixteen committees formed to oversee various aspects of the event's organization.</p></note> at Cincinnati, by John G. Whittier.<note type="editorial" resp="#be #el"><p>John Greenleaf Whittier (1807&#8211;1892) dedicated himself to abolitionist activities in the early 1830s. He was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society (est. December 1833), and held the editorship of the <title level="j">Pennsylvania Freeman</title> from March 1838 until February 1840. Convinced that the Constitution and the ballot could be used to attack slavery, he supported the Liberty Party and played an active part in its members' campaigns. Antislavery journalism continued to feature largely in his life; for thirteen years, he worked as corresponding editor for the <title level="j">National Era</title> (1847&#8211;1860).</p>
                    <p>Orthodox Quaker Whittier managed to reconcile his abhorrence of war with his support for conflict that furthered the antislavery cause; during the war he urged members of the Society of Friends to assist the war effort in noncombatant roles, as nurses in hospitals and as teachers among the freedpeople (Samuel T. Pickard, <title level="m">Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier</title> [London: Sampson Low, 1895], 2:440&#8211;41; see also "<ref target="nas.18630627.4">In War-Time</ref>"). Poetry had long been integral to his abolitionist mission. His first (unauthorized) collection of poetry, <title level="m">Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question in the United States, between 1830 and 1838</title>, was published by antislavery colleagues in 1837 (Randall Cluff, "Whittier, John Greenleaf," in <title level="m">American National Biography Online</title>). He continued to champion abolition in verse throughout the war. His poems often appeared in the <title level="j">Atlantic Monthly</title> (which he supported from its inception) and in the <title level="j">New York Independent</title>, and were widely reprinted in serials with antislavery sympathies.</p><p>Whittier probably sent the autograph manuscript of "What of the Day?" in response to a request from the "Sub-Committee on Autograph Letters." The committee collected over five hundred letters from "prominent men" and women for display and auction ([Charles Brandon Boynton?], <title level="m">History of the Great Western Sanitary Fair</title> [Cincinnati: Vent, 1864], 417). The lines of introduction that preface "What of the Day?" in the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> double as an advertisement for the forthcoming sale (held after the fair, in mid-March 1864).</p><p>Whittier's biographer comments that "What of the Day?" "was written in the height of the excitement of the [1856] presidential contest" between Republican John Fr&#233;mont and Democrat James Buchanan (Samuel T. Pickard, <title level="m">Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier</title> [Boston: Houghton, 1894], 1:387). Reprinted as a patriotic contribution to the fundraising efforts of the United States Sanitary Commission, "What of the Day?" became a Civil War poem.</p></note> This <lb/>autograph manuscript, together with a number of other <lb/>autograph poems contributed by the authors, many of <lb/>them unpublished, will be sold at auction on the 15th and <lb/>16th days of March next:]</p></note>
