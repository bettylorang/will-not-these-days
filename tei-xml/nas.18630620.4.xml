Some newspaper correspondents mistakenly reported that it was the Second Regiment which had taken part in the assault. In the summer of 1863 Boker's poem circulated in the antislavery press under the title "The Second Louisiana" (see also "The Second Louisiana" in the <title level="j">Christian Recorder</title>, June 13, 1863, and <ref target="aa.18630627.1">"The Second Louisiana"</ref> in the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, June 27, 1863). Boker probably wrote the poem in response to early reports, then changed the title to "The Black Regiment" when the mistake became apparent.</p><p>"Col. Daniel's Second Louisiana negro regiment distinguished itself . . . especially in charging upon the enemy's siege guns, losing killed and wounded over 600," reported the <title level="j">Boston Daily Evening Transcript</title> of June 6, 1863 (quoted by James G. Hollandsworth, <title level="m">The Louisiana Native Guards: The Black Military Experience during the Civil War</title> [Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1995], 63). "Nobly done, Second Regiment of Louisiana," proclaimed the <title level="j">Liberator</title> a fortnight later. General Nathaniel Banks's official report praised the First and Third Regiments. The <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> of June 13, 1863, brushed aside reporters' confusion as to which Louisiana regiments had taken part in the battle: "It is immaterial which statement is true, so long as the great fact remains; <emph rend="italic">that no such fighting has been seen since the war began</emph>."</p></note></head>

            <byline rend="right"><emph rend="smallcaps">George H. Boker.</emph><note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">Philadelphian George Henry Boker (1823&#8211;1890) gave up the law for a literary life in the 1840s. He wrote several plays, but success on the stage proved elusive; nevertheless, his household included several servants by 1860 (census records list his occupation as "Gent"). When the war broke out, Boker turned from drama to patriotic verse. He also cofounded Philadelphia's Union League in the winter of 1862; in addition to serving as the league's secretary, he used public poetry to promote Unionist sentiment in and beyond the city. His tribute to the "The Second Louisiana" was probably part of this larger mission. The poem was a hit in abolitionist circles.
