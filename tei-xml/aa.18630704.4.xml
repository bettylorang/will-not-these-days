Wilson (1820&#8211;?), antebellum journalist and teacher. In the 1840s and 1850s, Wilson contributed letters and articles to <title level="j">Frederick Douglass' Paper</title>, the <title level="j">Weekly Anglo-African</title> and the <title level="j">Anglo-African Magazine</title>&#8212;many of them under the pen name "Ethiop." Carla L. Peterson has argued that "In naming himself Ethiop, [Wilson] drew attention to his undiluted black blood and proudly identified himself with Africa" (<title level="m">Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City</title> [New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2011], 218). Wilson taught in Brooklyn and was one of the community leaders who established the New York Society for the Promotion of Education Among Colored Children in 1847. John W. Blassingame notes that Wilson also aided fugitive slaves as a member of the "Committee of Thirteen" (John W. Blassingame, ed., <title level="m">The Frederick Douglass Papers, Series 1: Speeches, Debates, and Interviews</title> [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982], 2:511).</p><p>Halfway through the Civil War, Wilson left his position as principal of Brooklyn's Colored Public School No. 1 and went south to establish a school for freedpeople in Washington, DC, under the auspices of the American Missionary Association. He taught in Washington until the end of the war, along with his wife, Mary, and daughter, Annie. The family remained in Washington; Wilson worked as a cashier in the Washington branch of the Freedmen's Savings Bank, as did his son-in-law, Thomas Boston.</p></note> <choice><orig>Princi-<lb/>pal</orig><reg>Principal</reg></choice> of Colored Public School No. 1, Brooklyn, was read by its <lb/>author at the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#el">musical</unclear> and literary entertainment, given on <lb/>Monday evening, <gap extent="two words" unit="chars" quantity="10" reason="illegible"/>, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#el" cert="medium">at the</unclear>  <gap extent="about four words" unit="chars" quantity="30" reason="illegible"/> <lb/>the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#kt">benefit</unclear> of the Sabbath School of St. Phillip's Church.</note>

                    <l>Far down in the South sits an ancient dark-brown Mother,<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">Wilson's ancestor figure occupies a position similar to that of "Africa" in Maria Lowell's 1849 poem (reprinted in the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> of <ref target="aa.18630905.4">September 5, 1863</ref> and in the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> of <ref target="nas.18630912.4">September 12, 1863</ref>). Lowell's continent mourns for her lost African children in a desert waste; Wilson's "dark-brown mother" mourns her children as she sits "and looketh out upon a boundless vista, / Blank and bleak, and black with sorrow" (lines 10&#8211;11). Each figure is represented as the mother of a race. Wilson offered a post-emancipation response to the argument in Lowell's poem, if not to the poem itself. "I was sole Queen the broad earth through," Lowell's Africa laments before retreating into silence at the end of the poem, to wait for "fate" to "lift" her from "sunken state." By contrast, Wilson's African Mother, situated "Far down in the South" of the United States, is roused from her grief by the post-emancipation achievements of her African American children and declared "a Queen" in America. The poem can be read as an indication of the war's influence on Wilson's black nationalism.</note></l>

                    <l>Sits there rocking herself to and fro with grief and sorrow;</l>
                    <l>Sits there 'neath a willow in the grave-yard.</l>
                    <l>Nor whispering winds, nor song of birds console her.</l>
                    <l>Sits there, not like Rachel&#8212;though sorrowing sadly</l>
                    <l>For her children.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">Rachel, wife of Jacob and mother of Joseph. "A voice is heard in Ramah, / lamentation and bitter weeping. / Rachel is weeping for her children, / because they are not" (Jeremiah 31:15). The mother figure in Wilson's poem can no longer weep for her children because the "fountains" of her eyes have run dry.</note> Her eyes are tearless and past weeping;</l>
                    <l>For long, long hath dried up all the fountains,</l>
                    <l>All the sources of her weeping.</l>
                    <l>She sits there and looketh out upon a boundless vista,</l>

                    <l>Sorrow for her children of which they robbed her,</l>
                    <l>Of which the cruel spoiler, one by one hath robbed her;</l>
                    <l>Robbed and gone&#8212;she knows not whither.</l>
                    <l>She sits there, with her long and <gap extent="one word" unit="chars" quantity="5" reason="illegible"/> fingers</l>
                    <l>Numbering, numbering up her absent children.</l>
                    <l>Her old white hair in the South-wind fluttering,</l>
                    <l>All the while she sits there, gazing on that boundless <lb/>vista.</l>
                    <l>By her lays a worn and tattered scrap of Bible,</l>
                    <l>Which though loved and cherished never read.</l>
                    <l>The laws forbade that dark-brown Mother reading.&#8212;</l>
                    <l>Reading that worn and tattered scrap of Bible,</l>
                    <l>And so it lay there, veiled in sorrow,</l>
                    <l>With that ancient Mother's sorrow for her children.</l>
                    <l>Scattered dust!&#8212;like scattered seed upon the fallow!</l>
                    <l>Scattered dust!&#8212;scattered through a mighty nation!<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">Repetition here and elsewhere shows the influence of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's bestselling epic poem, <title level="m">The Song of Hiawatha</title> (1855). This repetition does more than suggest a literary man's stylistic homage or an experienced orator's shrewd choice; it identifies "Our Dark-Brown Mother" as a foundational narrative of race and nation.</note></l>
                    <l>And so far down in the South sits that dark-brown Mother,</l>

                    <l>And if a tear into her dim old eye starting,</l>
                    <l>T' will turn to joy, though e'en a tear of sorrow.</l>
                    <l>What manner of men ye are, come forth and show her;</l>
                    <l>Come forth strong and bold; come forth true men,</l>
                    <l>And your ancient Mother, now sadly sorrowing</l>
                    <l>Broken, shrunken,&#8212;will the new life beget her;</l>
                    <l>Beget the new and fresh blood, and abide among you.</l>
                    <l>Revered and cherished, loved and loving.</l>
                    <l>Ye hardy sons; ye toiling brown-faced children,</l>
                    <l>Now free from every earthly shackle,</l>

                    <l>And too, ye mothers! Mothers of our new strength;</l>
                    <l>Strength in the path of progress plodding;</l>
                    <l>Strength that's grappling in the nations struggle,</l>

                    <l>And let your children weave a chaplet,</l>
                    <l>And with that chaplet proudly crown her;</l>
                    <l>For she sits no longer in the ancient pine-grove,</l>
                    <l>No longer sits in her ancient sorrow;</l>
                    <l>But a Queen is our ancient dark-brown Mother,</l>
                    <l>Amidst her noble new-born children,</l>
                    <l>A part of a great and mighty nation,</l>
                    <l>A Queen is our ancient dark-brown Mother.</l>
