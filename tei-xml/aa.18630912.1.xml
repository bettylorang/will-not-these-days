Some newspaper correspondents mistakenly reported that it was the Second Regiment which had taken part in the assault. In the summer of 1863 Boker's poem circulated in the antislavery press under the title "The Second Louisiana" (see also "The Second Louisiana" in the <title level="j">Christian Recorder</title>, June 13, 1863, and <ref target="aa.18630627.1">"The Second Louisiana"</ref> in the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, June 27, 1863). Boker probably wrote the poem in response to early reports, then changed the title to "The Black Regiment" when the mistake became apparent.</p><p>"Col. Daniel's Second Louisiana negro regiment distinguished itself . . . especially in charging upon the enemy's siege guns, losing killed and wounded over 600," reported the <title level="j">Boston Daily Evening Transcript</title> of June 6, 1863 (quoted by James G. Hollandsworth, <title level="m">The Louisiana Native Guards: The Black Military Experience during the Civil War</title> [Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1995], 63). "Nobly done, Second Regiment of Louisiana," proclaimed the <title level="j">Liberator</title> a fortnight later. General Nathaniel Banks's official report praised the First and Third Regiments. The <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> of June 13, 1863, brushed aside reporters' confusion as to which Louisiana regiments had taken part in the battle: "It is immaterial which statement is true, so long as the great fact remains; <emph rend="italic">that no such fighting has been seen since the war began</emph>."</p></note></head>

His father, Daniel, was a cabinetmaker from Ireland who immigrated to the United States and settled in Philadelphia before John's birth. John trained as a specialist property lawyer. <title level="m">Studies</title>&#8212;his first and last collection of poetry, privately published in 1862&#8212;is dedicated to Joseph Ball, a conveyancer of Frankford, Pennsylvania. The book received a lukewarm reception in the <title level="j">Liberator</title> (April 10, 1863). Newspaper poetry provides the only extant record of Dorgan's antislavery sympathies. During the Civil War, Dorgan lived in Philadelphia with his father and "Annie" (probably his elder sister). According to the <title level="j">New York Times</title> of December 31, 1867, he died of consumption that year.</note></byline>
