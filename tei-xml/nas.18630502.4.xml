                <head type="main" subtype="authorial" rend="center">OUR PROMISE TO THE SLAVE.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>The Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 stated that "all persons held as slaves" in rebel states "are, and henceforward shall be free." Lincoln also pledged that the federal government and military would "recognize and maintain" this freedom (Roy P. Basler, ed., <title level="m">The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</title> [New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953], 6:29&#8211;30).</p><p>The president publicly announced his intention to take this step in the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation (September 22, 1862). By the end of December, however, Lincoln's views and Northern public opinion had shifted toward a more radical position. The final proclamation made no mention of compensated emancipation or colonization; instead, it paved the way for African American men to serve as soldiers and sailors in the US armed forces (see <title level="m">Freedom: A Documentary History of Emancipation</title>, ed. Ira Berlin, et al. [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985], series 1, 1:36&#8211;37).</p></note></head>

Y. Tribune</emph>.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Horace Greeley (1811&#8211;1872) established the <title level="j">New York Tribune</title> as a Whig daily in 1841. From its earliest days, the title was animated by a spirit of reform. By the mid-1850s, the various editions of the paper&#8212;daily, weekly, and semiweekly&#8212;had almost 280,000 subscribers (Adam Tuchinsky, <title level="m">Horace Greeley's New-York Tribune: Civil War-Era Socialism and the Crisis of Free Labor</title> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2009], 2). Greeley, a force in the fledgling Republican Party, adopted a more radical stance against slavery in the 1850s. During the war, the <title level="j">Tribune</title> "advocated vigorous prosecution of the war and expansion of its meaning: namely, that the war should become an emancipationist crusade, and that the emancipated slaves ought to be armed" (Tuchinsky, 171&#8211;72).</p><p>Former <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> editor Sydney Howard Gay managed the <title level="j">Tribune</title> from 1862 until 1865. Gay sidelined his own abolitionist convictions and concentrated on satisfying the general hunger for timely war news (Tuchinsky, 217). But Greeley, in his famous editorial address of August 1862, "The Prayer of Twenty Millions," urged Lincoln to make war on slavery as a matter of military and moral necessity. Lincoln, then waiting to announce the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, responded by stating that "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery" (Roy P. Basler, ed., <title level="m">The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</title> [New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953], 5:388).</p></note></note>

Mason's early poems appeared in local newspapers under the name "Caro." In 1852 she moved with her family from Marblehead to Fitchburg, Massachusetts. <title level="m">Utterance; or Private Voices to the Public Heart</title>, the only collection of Mason's poetry to appear in her lifetime, was published in the same year. She married Fitchburg lawyer Charles Mason in 1853. During the 1850s she contributed poetry to Washington's <title level="j">National Era</title>; her choice of publication suggests that she had antislavery and reform sympathies.</p><p>Throughout the war, Mason contributed poems to a host of newspapers, including the <title level="j">Liberator</title>, the <title level="j">New York Independent</title>, the <title level="j">Christian Inquirer</title>, the <title level="j">Fitchburg Daily Sentinel</title>, the <title level="j">Boston Commonwealth</title> and the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>. She also tackled more explicitly antislavery subjects at this time. Her "<ref target="nas.18640130.4a">Sowing in Hope</ref>" (<title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, January 30, 1864) suggests that she was a friend of <title level="j">Liberator</title> editor William Lloyd Garrison, who apparently encouraged her to have faith in the moral influence of her words. Although she was primarily known as a poet, Mason also wrote "short stories, essays . . . and frequent letters to local newspapers" (Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, "Briggs Family Papers, 1820&#8211;1915: A Finding Aid"). Her husband published a posthumous collection of her verse, <title level="m">The Lost Ring and Other Poems</title>, in 1891.</p></note></byline>
