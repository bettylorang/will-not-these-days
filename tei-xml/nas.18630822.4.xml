                <byline rend="center">BY BELLE BUSH.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw el">Arabella C. Bush (1830&#8211;?), poet and teacher. Relatively little is known about Bush's life. Born in New York, she moved with her family to Pennsylvania at some point before 1853. In 1857 she and her elder sisters founded the Adelphian Institute, a seminary for women in Norristown (Theodore W. Bean, ed., <title level="m">History of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania</title> [Philadelphia: Everts and Peck, 1884], 763). In her preface to <title level="m">Voices of the Morning</title> (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1865), Bush gives the names of twenty-three "papers and magazines which have from time to time published my articles, either as contributions or selections" ([2]). The fact that her list includes the <title level="j">Liberator</title>, the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, and the <title level="j">Banner of Light</title> suggests that she had some sympathy with abolition, women's rights, and unorthodox faith. The 1870 census shows that she moved to Belvidere, New Jersey, with her teacher sisters; she is described as coprincipal of another girls' school (the Belvidere Academy). Census records for 1910 suggest that she lived into her eighties.</note></byline>

                    <l rend="indented2">Not one, not one,<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>The awful new scale of Civil War battles forced Americans to grapple with the meaning of individual deaths and disappearances in the context of mass slaughter. Writers like Bush explored and reasserted the significance of single deaths at a moment when the first national cemeteries were being established; this phrase may show the same impulse toward recovery and acknowledgment at work.</p>
                        <p>Historian Drew Gilpin Faust observes that the Battle of Gettysburg "made the dead&#8212;and the problem they represented&#8212;starkly visible to northern citizens"; the dedication ceremony that took place at Gettysburg National Cemetery on November 19, 1863, "acknowledged a new public importance for the dead" (<title level="m">This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War</title> [New York: Knopf, 2009], 99, 101). But the problem of the missing remained. How could the dead be acknowledged if they remained "unknown"? Bush's poem offers the consolation of a divine perspective: "not one" soldier's death was missed by God, and each one furthered the Union's cause.</p></note></l>

Lee's advance into Pennsylvania provoked panic in the North in June 1863. Confederate and Union armies clashed at Gettysburg. The battle took place July 1&#8211;3, 1863, and news of Lee's defeat reached Washington, DC on July 4. As Northerners celebrated, enormous ambulance trains carried thousands of casualties toward city hospitals. By the end of the battle, 23,000 Union soldiers and 28,000 Confederates were killed, wounded, or missing (James M. McPherson, <title level="m">Battle Cry of Freedom: The American Civil War</title> [London: Penguin, 1991], 664).</note></l>
