            <note type="newspaper-editorial">&#8212;<title level="j">Independent</title>.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>The <title level="j">New York Independent</title>, established as a Congregationalist weekly in December 1848. The title's "independent" antislavery stance prevented it from capitalizing on an affiliation with subscribers of any one political persuasion, and "its extreme position with regard to the Fugitive Slave Law almost wrecked it in its second year" (Frank L. Mott, <title level="m">A History of American Magazines, 1850&#8211;1865</title> [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1938], 2:369). In spite of this beginning, the <title level="j">Independent</title> succeeded impressively and had over 35,000 subscribers by the time war broke (Mott, 371). As the war progressed, editorials political and secular nudged matters of religion, Congregationalist or otherwise, to the margins.</p>
                <p>The celebrity of Henry Ward Beecher (1813&#8211;1887) must have contributed to the <title level="j">Independent</title>'s success. "Star contributor" Beecher was named editor during 1861&#8211;65. Theodore Tilton, his assistant, directed editorial policy and took over the editorship in all but name when Beecher embarked for Europe in 1863; two years later, he was officially recognized as editor-in-chief. By the time war broke out, Tilton had established himself as one of the young stars of the American Anti-Slavery Society. He and William Lloyd Garrison became friends after <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> editor Oliver Johnson introduced them in 1856; Garrison described Tilton as "a fine young man . . . . connected with the N. Y. <title level="j">Independent</title>, who is beginning to take a vital interest in radical abolitionism" (<title level="m">The Letters of William Lloyd Garrison: From Disunionism to the Brink of War, 1850–1860</title>, ed. Louis Ruchames [Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1975], 4:415). Johnson, Tilton, and Garrison were united by a common profession as well as shared antislavery convictions. During the war each reprinted items from the other's newspapers.</p>
                
                <p>The <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> editors clashed with Tilton in the aftermath of the Draft Riots. The <title level="j">Independent</title> published Robert Hamilton's appeal for subscriptions and donations, but to this Tilton appended a comment that challenged the need for a "distinctively 'African' paper": "Our countrymen of African lineage are not primarily and predominantly negroes, but MEN&#8212;most of them, we trust, Christians; and everything which tends to isolate and separate them&#8212;to render them exclusive, peculiar, clannish&#8212;is ill-considered" (<title level="j">Independent</title>, July 30, 1863). His comments riled the Hamiltons, who published editorials defending the value of their newspaper. "Here is <title level="j">The Independent</title>, a newspaper . . . of such high Abolition pretensions, as unblushingly to offer itself as a supplanter or substitute for our poor journal to our colored subscribers and purchasers," wrote "Humanity" (<title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, August 8, 1863). How, a later editorial asked, could Tilton "expect us to trust any man simply because he publishes a paper in which is advocated anti-slavery sentiments?" (<title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, September 19, 1863). The <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> helped African Americans in their struggle to become "citizens of the United States," and its title was "truthful, ethnically speaking" (<title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, September 19, 1863; <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, October 3, 1863). "Moreover, if we change our name, of what use could it be, unless all the nation should be stricken with color blindness?" (<title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, October 3, 1863).</p></note></note>
