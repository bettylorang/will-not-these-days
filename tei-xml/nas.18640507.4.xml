Johnson" in the table of contents for volume 13 of the <title level="j">Atlantic Monthly</title>. The poem appeared in the April 1864 issue of the magazine. (According to the magazine's convention, poems were typically unattributed in the body of the magazine, but tables of contents attributed the works.) Laura Winthrop Johnson (1824&#8211;1889) was the sister of Major Theodore Winthrop, an <title level="j">Atlantic Monthly</title> contributor and one of the Union's first martyrs. In 1862, after Winthrop's death, Laura became good friends with Annie Fields, wife of <title level="j">Atlantic</title> editor James T. Fields. They discussed literature, and Laura showed Annie some of her verses. Annie gave one of them, "On Picket Duty," to her husband (Rita K. Gollin, <title level="m">Annie Adams Fields: Woman of Letters</title> [Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2002], 150&#8211;51).</p><p>"On Picket Duty" also appeared in the <ref target="aa.18640514.4">May 14, 1864</ref> issue of the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>.</p></note></head>

                    <l>I thought of Shiloh's tainted air;<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">The miasma over the Shiloh battlefield. Approximately 20,000 soldiers were killed or wounded during the Battle of Shiloh (April 6&#8211;7, 1862). The battle introduced mid-nineteenth-century Americans to warfare on a new and terrible scale. On the battle's second day, advancing Union soldiers were confronted with the previous day's dead and wounded (James M. McPherson, <title level="m">Battle Cry of Freedom: The American Civil War</title> [London: Penguin, 1991], 413).</note></l>
                    <l>Of Richmond's prisons, foul and bare;<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">Reports of the horrific conditions in Richmond's military prisons caused outrage in the North, and provided Union editors with ammunition in the ongoing propaganda war. In early December 1863, <title level="j">Harper's Weekly</title> published a double-page illustration of skeletal Union prisoners at Richmond's Belle Isle, heavily guarded by well-fed, smiling men. More shocking illustrations followed in the latter half of the war. Focused on the enemy's crimes, Johnson does not consider the brutal conditions in Union prisons. As Benjamin Cloyd points out, "grim statistics" show that each side failed "to care appropriately for prisoners of war" (Benjamin G. Cloyd, <title level="m">Haunted by Atrocity: Civil War Prisons in American Memory</title> [Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010], 11).</note></l>

Johnson casts the South as the lost son, and the North as his righteous elder brother. In the biblical parable, the "kind Father" is God. However, readers who encountered "On Picket Duty" in the spring of 1864 may have interpreted Johnson's figure as a forgiving Lincoln. The president had issued his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction on December 8, 1863. For more on the Proclamation, see Eric Foner, <title level="m">Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863&#8211;1877</title> (New York: Harper Collins, 2002), 35.</note></l>
