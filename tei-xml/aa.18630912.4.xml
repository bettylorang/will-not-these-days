In a letter published in the <title level="j">New York Times</title> on September 5, 1863, prominent Peace Democrat and US representative from New York Fernando Wood wrote, "I believe that the Union has not been and cannot be severed beyond restoration, unless it may be by a continuance for another Presidential term of the policy of the last two years. There has been no period within one year in which the Union could not have been restored, provided those in authority in the Executive and Legislative Departments of the Government had desired it. It can yet be restored, but in my opinion only by conciliatory measures and other equally constitutional methods" ("A Note from Hon. Fernando Wood").</note></head>

Wipe out the spot!<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">Figured as both stain and disease, slavery compromised the American Republic's ideals, and endangered the Republic itself. B. T. J.'s metaphors were well established. In 1854, Lincoln argued that slavery was "hid away, in the constitution, just as an afflicted man hides away a wen or a cancer, which he dares not cut out at once, lest he bleed to death; with the promise, nevertheless, that the cutting may begin at the end of a given time" (<title level="m">Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings</title>, ed. Roy P. Basler [1946; New York: Da Capo, 2001], 313). "Our republican robe is soiled, and trailed in the dust," he told his audience moments later (315). <title level="j">Liberator</title> editor William Lloyd Garrison used the same analogy in the same year: "Some men still are talking of preventing the spread of the cancer, but leaving it just where it is" (<title level="m">No Compromise with Slavery</title> [New York: American Anti-Slavery Society, 1854], 27).</note></l>

Lord Byron used the tale as the basis for his famous metaphor in "The Giaour" (1813): "The Mind, that broods o'er guilty woes, / Is like the Scorpion girt by fire" (Lord Byron, <title level="m">Selected Poems</title>, ed. Susan J. Wolfson and Peter J. Manning [New York: Penguin, 1996], ll. 422&#8211;23). B. T. J. echoes Byron's phrasing but transforms the simile: American slavery will destroy itself.</note></l>

            <dateline>New York, August 22, 1863.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">The New York dateline places the poem's declaration of patriotic allegiance against the backdrop of the New York City Draft Riots (July 13&#8211;16, 1863). In the aftermath of the riots, which saw mobs attack African American New Yorkers and destroy their property, Peace Democrat politicians like Fernando Wood and New York governor Horatio Seymour were blamed for inciting the violence.</note></dateline>

William Cullen Bryant (1794&#8211;1878) began to write for the title in 1826, having struggled to make a living as a poet; by 1830 he was the <title level="j">Post</title>'s editor-in-chief, and the daily's financial prospects looked good (Allan Nevins, <title level="m">The Evening Post: A Century of Journalism</title> [New York: Russell and Russell, 1968], 134-136). Committed to Free Soil principles, Bryant severed the <title level="j">Post</title>'s connection with the Democratic Party in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) and backed the fledgling Republican Party in 1856. He threw his weight behind Lincoln's presidential campaign in 1860. Although the <title level="j">Post</title> remained staunchly Republican throughout the war, Bryant did not shrink from criticizing Lincoln's policies. The <title level="j">Post</title> "shared with the <title level="j">Tribune</title> the advocacy of what came to be called the 'radical' Republican doctrines during the Civil War&#8212;namely, emancipation, the need of strong and swift military measures, and the removal of pro-slavery and Democratic leaders from the government and army" (Frank Luther Mott, <title level="m">American Journalism: A History of Newspapers in the United States Through Twenty Years, 1690&#8211;1940</title> [New York: Macmillan, 1941], 5:344).</p><p>Despite crediting the <title level="j">Post</title>, the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> may have reprinted this piece from the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, which featured the poem in its issue of <ref target="nas.18630905.4">September 5, 1863</ref>. The poems are identical in both printings, including their attribution to the <title level="j">New York Evening Post</title>.</p></note></note>
