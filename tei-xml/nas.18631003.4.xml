Novelist E. D. E. N. Southworth sent Whittier the "whole story" of Frietchie's patriotic defiance, given to her by friends "who were in Frederick at the time" (Samuel T. Pickard, <title level="m">Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier</title> [Boston: Houghton, 1894], 2:454). Whittier used the main features of Southworth's narrative in his poem, which <title level="j">Atlantic Monthly</title> publisher-editor James T. Fields eagerly accepted for publication. A controversy soon arose about the veracity of Whittier's version of events (Brayton Harris, <title level="m">Blue and Gray in Black and White: Newspapers in the Civil War</title> [Washington: Brassey's, 1999], 270&#8211;73). The poet maintained that he believed the story to be true, yet he also disclaimed any responsibility for particular details: "That there was a Dame Frietchie in Frederick who loved the old flag is not disputed by any one. As for the rest I do not feel responsible. If there was no such occurrence, so much the worse for Frederick City" (457).</note></head>

                <byline rend="center">BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>John Greenleaf Whittier (1807&#8211;1892) dedicated himself to abolitionist activities in the early 1830s. He was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society (est. December 1833), and held the editorship of the <title level="j">Pennsylvania Freeman</title> from March 1838 until February 1840. Convinced that the Constitution and the ballot could be used to attack slavery, he supported the Liberty Party and played an active part in its members' campaigns. Antislavery journalism continued to feature largely in his life; for thirteen years, he worked as corresponding editor for the <title level="j">National Era</title> (1847&#8211;1860).</p>
                    <p>Orthodox Quaker Whittier managed to reconcile his abhorrence of war with his support for conflict that furthered the antislavery cause; during the war he urged members of the Society of Friends to assist the war effort in noncombatant roles, as nurses in hospitals and as teachers among the freedpeople (Samuel T. Pickard, <title level="m">Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier</title> [London: Sampson Low, 1895], 2:440&#8211;41; see also "<ref target="nas.18630627.4">In War-Time</ref>"). Poetry had long been integral to his abolitionist mission. His first (unauthorized) collection of poetry, <title level="m">Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question in the United States, between 1830 and 1838</title>, was published by antislavery colleagues in 1837 (Randall Cluff, "Whittier, John Greenleaf," in <title level="m">American National Biography Online</title>). He continued to champion abolition in verse throughout the war. His poems often appeared in the <title level="j">Atlantic Monthly</title> (which he supported from its inception) and in the <title level="j">New York Independent</title>, and were widely reprinted in serials with antislavery sympathies.</p> 
                    <p>"Barbara Frietchie" was first published in the October 1863 issue of the <title level="j">Atlantic Monthly</title>. Whittier included it in <title level="m">In War Time and Other Poems</title> (1864).</p></note></byline>

At the same time, he would deal a severe blow to morale in the Union and encourage Democrat opposition to the war by fighting the Army of the Potomac on Northern soil.</p><p>General "Stonewall" Jackson's division entered Frederick, one of Maryland's largest cities, on the morning of September 6, 1862; by evening, most of the Army of Northern Virginia were camped in the vicinity. Two days later, Lee addressed the "People of Maryland," declaring the Confederacy's intention to "to aid you in throwing off this foreign yoke, to enable you again to enjoy the inalienable rights of freemen" (James M. McPherson, <title level="m">Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam</title> [New York: Oxford University Press, 2002], 91). The proclamation failed to stir the populace.</p></note></l>

Morgan's Ohio Raid (July 2&#8211;26, 1863) may be particularly significant in the context of the poem, as correspondence quoted by Samuel T. Pickard suggests that Whittier wrote "Barbara Frietchie" after July 21 and before August 24, 1863 (<title level="m">Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier</title> [London: Sampson Low, 1895], 2:454, 458).</note> no more.</l>
