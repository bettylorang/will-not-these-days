Working without an organizational affiliation, she began to take urgently needed supplies forward to the Army of the Potomac in the winter of 1861&#8211;62. Later in 1862, she assisted casualties and medics under fire. In early April 1863, Barton set out for Hilton Head, South Carolina, ostensibly accompanying her quartermaster brother, David. Senator Henry Wilson, an influential supporter of Barton's activities, had secured the post for David so that Barton herself could pursue her own relief work (Elizabeth Brown Pryor, <title level="m">Clara Barton: Professional Angel</title> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1987], 110&#8211;11). During her months on the Sea Islands, she became great friends with reformer Frances Dana Gage. Barton's biographer Elizabeth Pryor argues that Gage's influence on Clara is "impossible to overestimate"; her views on race and gender equality evolved as a result of her friendship, and "she began to view herself as an active proponent of woman suffrage" (120&#8211;21). Barton provided relief to troops on Morris Island in the summer of 1863, but General Quincy A. Gillmore dismissed her from the field in September; after a difficult autumn of anxiety and inaction, she left Hilton Head on December 31. Later in life, Barton played a crucial part in establishing the American National Red Cross.</note></head>

            <byline rend="right"><emph rend="smallcaps">Frances D. Gage</emph><note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>By the time the war began, Ohioan Frances Dana Barker Gage (1808&#8211;1884) had established herself as a leading advocate of women's rights and abolition, in the reform press and on the platform. A laudatory biographical sketch in <title level="m">Eminent Women of the Age</title> (1868) describes how she found time "to read, and write for leading journals, and often to speak, too, on temperance, slavery, and woman's rights" while raising a family of eight ([Elizabeth Cady Stanton], "Frances D. Gage," in <title level="m">Eminent Women of the Age; Being Narratives of the Lives and Deeds of the Most Prominent Women of the Present Generation</title>, by James Parton, et al. [Hartford, CT: Betts, 1868], 383). Gage contributed to journals such as the <title level="j">Ladies' Repository</title>, the <title level="j">Ohio Cultivator</title>, the <title level="j">Lily: A Monthly Journal Devoted to Temperance and Literature</title>, the <title level="j">Saturday Visitor</title>, and the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>&#8212;a mixture of titles linked by her reform agendas and regional affiliations. In the early 1850s Gage also presided over a number of statewide and national women's rights conventions, including the Akron convention of 1851, where Sojourner Truth challenged the patriarchy and delegates' racial prejudices. Gage's recollections of Truth's speech were published in the <title level="j">Standard</title> halfway through the war (<title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, May 2, 1863, [4]).</p>
                <p>In 1862 Gage and her daughter Mary joined the Northern mission to educate the freedpeople and prove the moral and economic superiority of free labor on South Carolina's Sea Islands. Gage stayed on Parris Island for over a year, without an official title or salary, as "supervisor" to approximately 500 freedmen, women, and children. During this period, she supplied the <title level="j">New York Independent</title> and the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> with "South Carolina correspondence." She returned to the North in the winter of 1863 and embarked on a lecture tour to raise relief funds. A week before the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> published "Autumn Days in South Carolina," the editor urged lyceum organizers to book Gage. "Her usual topic will be 'Home Life among the Freedmen,' and we assure the lecture managers that from the stores of her experience and observation she will present matter of deep interest and importance" (<title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, November 7, 1863, [2]). In as much as it contributed to Gage's public profile, the poem functioned as an advertisement. Gage continued her war work as "an unsalaried agent of the Sanitary Commission" in Memphis, Vicksburg, and Natchez ([Stanton], "Frances D. Gage," 384&#8211;85).</p></note></byline>
