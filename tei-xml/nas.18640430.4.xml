                <byline rend="center">BY AUGUSTA COOPER KIMBALL.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Augusta Cooper Bristol (1835&#8211;1910). Cooper, born in Croyden, New Hampshire, taught at a local school for seven years before she married printer Gustavus Kimball in 1858. They had a child and moved west on the eve of the Civil War. When the marriage failed in 1862, Cooper moved back to her parents' home with her daughter. Kimball divorced her, "on the ground of desertion" (Bessie Bristol Mason, "Biographical Sketch," in <title level="m">The Present Phase of Woman's Advancement and Other Addresses</title> by Augusta Cooper Bristol [Boston: Christopher, 1916], 7).</p><p>During the war, Cooper contributed poetry to newspapers and magazines, including the <title level="j">Christian Inquirer</title>, the <title level="j">Continental Monthly</title>, the <title level="j">New York Independent</title> and the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>. She moved to Carbondale, Illinois, after marrying Louis Bristol in 1866. <title level="m">Poems</title>, her first collection, was published by a Boston firm two years later. Abiel Abbot Livermore&#8212;Unitarian minister and <title level="j">Christian Inquirer</title> editor&#8212;supplied the book's laudatory introduction. After the war, she began to lecture, and "for twenty years, she was constantly occupied as a public speaker" (8). In the early 1880s her subjects included "The Evolution of Character," "The Philosophy of Comte and Spencer," "The Scientific Basis of Morality," and "Labor and Capital." She undertook European research and spoke on topics relating to social science at national and international events. Cooper also supported currency reform and was actively involved in the Association for the Advancement of Women.</p></note></byline>

In Greek mythology, the Spartoi sprang from dragon teeth. After Cadmus killed a dragon guarding the Spring of Ares, he sowed half its teeth like seeds&#8212;as the goddess Athena had told him. The warriors who rose from the earth were known as the "Sown Men" (Pierre Grimal, <title level="m">Dictionary of Classical Mythology</title> [London: Penguin, 1990], 79).</p><p>Cooper's vision of an infinite number of Union volunteers was a patriotic fantasy. The federal government introduced a national draft in 1863. Nevertheless, the hopes of pro-Union Northerners ran high in the spring of 1864. Before Grant crossed the Rapidan River in early May, the Union armies seemed poised for significant success (James M. McPherson, <title level="m">Battle Cry of Freedom: The American Civil War</title> [London: Penguin, 1991], 718). Shocking numbers of casualties and a lack of military success, however, caused Northern morale to collapse over the course of the summer. By mid-August Lincoln expected that ex-general and "War Democrat" George B. McClellan would win the upcoming presidential election.</p></note></l>
