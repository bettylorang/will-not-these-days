Census data for 1850 suggest that he was the eldest son of a Merrimack County farmer.</p><p>On June 20, 1861, the New Hampshire volunteers moved south to Washington, DC, where they settled into Camp Sullivan. The regiment took part in the battle of Bull Run on July 21, and suffered casualties. Enoch Adams reported at least six men missing from Clay's company (Duane E. Shaffer, <title level="m">Men of Granite: New Hampshire's Soldiers in the Civil War</title> [Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2008], 36). Clay died on October 6, 1861, while the regiment manned Washington defenses at Bladensburg, Maryland. He may have succumbed to wounds or to one of the several diseases that were a deadly, everyday feature of army life.</p></note></head>

Regt.<note type="editorial" resp="#el #bw"><p>Like Bradley Clay, Enoch George Adams (1829&#8211;1900) enlisted as a private in the Second New Hampshire Regiment's Company D. In a letter to his mother dated November 26, 1861, Adams "credited himself, as a Union soldier, with loosening 'every fetter from the trembling slave'" (David A. Cecere, "Carrying the Home Front to War: Soldiers, Race, and New England Culture during the Civil War," in <title level="m">Union Soldiers and the Northern Home Front: Wartime Experiences, Postwar Adjustments</title> [New York: Fordham University Press, 2002], 299). If the phrase hints that Adams was prone to self-aggrandizement, it also provides evidence of his antislavery sympathies. This early commitment to a war of emancipation is less surprising, given that Adams's family was "the New Hampshire branch of the illustrious Massachusetts Adamses" (Cecere, 306).</p><p>Days before Bradley Clay's death, Adams was promoted to the rank of sergeant. He was wounded in the neck at the Battle of Williamsburg (May 5, 1862) and returned home to recover. Adams rejoined his regiment in September as second lieutenant (Duane E. Shaffer, <title level="m">Men of Granite: New Hampshire's Soldiers in the Civil War</title> [Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2008], 62). He survived the regiment's subsequent engagements and was mustered out in early May 1864. He rejoined the army in the winter of 1864 and served at bleak Fort Rice in Dakota Territory.</p></note></byline>
