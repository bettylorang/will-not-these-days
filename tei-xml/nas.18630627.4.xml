                <byline rend="center">BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>John Greenleaf Whittier (1807&#8211;1892) dedicated himself to abolitionist activities in the early 1830s. He was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society (est. December 1833) and held the editorship of the <title level="j">Pennsylvania Freeman</title> from March 1838 until February 1840. Convinced that the Constitution and the ballot could be used to attack slavery, he supported the Liberty Party and played an active part in its members' campaigns. Antislavery journalism continued to feature largely in his life; for thirteen years, he worked as corresponding editor for the <title level="j">National Era</title> (1847&#8211;1860).</p>
                    <p>Orthodox Quaker Whittier managed to reconcile his abhorrence of war with his support for conflict that furthered the antislavery cause; during the war he urged members of the Society of Friends to assist the war effort in non-combatant roles, as nurses in hospitals and as teachers among the freedpeople (Samuel T. Pickard, <title level="m">Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier</title> [London: Sampson Low, 1895], 2:440&#8211;41). Poetry had long been integral to his abolitionist mission. His first (unauthorized) collection of poetry, <title level="m">Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question in the United States, between 1830 and 1838</title>, was published by antislavery colleagues in 1837 (Randall Cluff, "Whittier, John Greenleaf," in <title level="m">American National Biography Online</title>). He continued to champion abolition in verse throughout the war. His poems often appeared in the <title level="j">Atlantic Monthly</title> (which he supported from its inception) and in the <title level="j">New York Independent</title>, and were widely reprinted in serials with antislavery sympathies. "In War-Time" became the title piece in Whittier's collection <title level="m">In War Time and Other Poems</title> (1864), which also includes "Mithridates at Chios." For "Mithridates at Chios," see the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> of <ref target="nas.18630516.4">May 16, 1863</ref>, and the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> of <ref target="aa.18630523.4">May 23, 1863</ref>.</p></note></byline>

Situated in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, the first school remained open for only four years (1784&#8211;88). Moses Brown revived the project decades later; the Friends accepted his donation of a farm and land near Providence in 1814, and the New England Yearly Meeting Boarding School opened on New Year's Day, 1819. The school flourished (Rayner Wickersham Kelsey, <title level="m">Centennial History of Moses Brown School, 1819&#8211;1919</title> [Providence, RI: Moses Brown School, 1919]). Its alumni formed an association in 1859 with the aim of raising funds for scholarships and facilities, and renewing "cherished associations" between old members (<title level="j">Proceedings of the Alumni Association of Friends' Yearly Meeting School</title> [Providence: Knowles, 1863], 9).</p><p>John Greenleaf Whittier did not attend the school; the association elected him as an honorary member at its second meeting in June 1860 (<title level="m">Report of the Proceedings of the Second Annual Meeting of the Alumni Association of the New England Yearly Meeting School</title> [Philadelphia: Collins, 1860], 26).  He wrote "The Quaker Alumni" for the same occasion (each alumni association meeting included a lecture and a poem). He contributed "In War-Time" for the same purpose three years later.</p></note></note>

Committed abolitionist Whittier believed that his antebellum contemporaries had lapsed in their antislavery mission and had fallen short of the immediate emancipationist examples set by their eighteenth-century predecessors, John Woolman and Anthony Benezet. Lincoln's decision to make emancipation a war aim in 1862 would test the limits of Quaker pacifism by forcing Friends to "choose between liberty for slaves and the preservation of the union" (Ryan P. Jordan, <title level="m">Slavery and the Meetinghouse: The Quakers and the Abolitionist Dilemma, 1820&#8211;1865</title> [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007], 121); "In War-Time" addresses this moment of choice as an opportunity for renewed activism.</note></l>

Only in February 1864 did Congress make allowance for conscientious objectors (Scott Reynolds Nelson and Carol Sheriff, <title level="m">A People at War: Civilians and Soldiers in America's Civil War, 1854&#8211;1877</title> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008], 202).</p><p>Pacifism was a fundamental Quaker principle, yet antislavery Friends' support for violent resistance had increased in the wake of the Compromise of 1850 (Ryan P. Jordan, <title level="m">Slavery and the Meetinghouse: The Quakers and the Abolitionist Dilemma, 1820&#8211;1865</title> [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007], 125). At the beginning of the war, Whittier had urged members of the Society of Friends to support the war effort as relief workers: "Steadily and faithfully maintaining our testimony against war, we owe it to the cause of truth, to show that exalted heroism and generous self-sacrifice are not incompatible with our pacific principles" (Samuel T. Pickard, <title level="m">Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier</title> [Boston: Houghton, 1894], 2:441). He reiterated and elaborated on that call in his alumni poem.</p></note></l>

            <note type="newspaper-editorial">&#8212;<title level="j" rend="italic">Independent</title>.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>The <title level="j">New York Independent</title>, established as a Congregationalist weekly in December 1848. The title's "independent" antislavery stance prevented it from capitalizing on an affiliation with subscribers of any one political persuasion, and "its extreme position with regard to the Fugitive Slave Law almost wrecked it in its second year" (Frank L. Mott, <title level="m">A History of American Magazines, 1850&#8211;1865</title> [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1938], 2:369). In spite of this beginning, the <title level="j">Independent</title> succeeded impressively and had over 35,000 subscribers by the time war broke (Mott, 371). As the war progressed, editorials political and secular nudged matters of religion, Congregationalist or otherwise, to the margins.</p>
                <p>The celebrity of Henry Ward Beecher (1813&#8211;1887) must have contributed to the <title level="j">Independent</title>'s success. "Star contributor" Beecher was named editor during 1861&#8211;65. Theodore Tilton, his assistant, directed editorial policy and took over the editorship in all but name when Beecher embarked for Europe in 1863; two years later, he was officially recognized as editor-in-chief. By the time war broke out, Tilton had established himself as one of the young stars of the American Anti-Slavery Society. He and William Lloyd Garrison became friends after <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> editor Oliver Johnson introduced them in 1856; Garrison described Tilton as "a fine young man . . . . connected with the N. Y. <title level="j">Independent</title>, who is beginning to take a vital interest in radical abolitionism" (<title level="m">The Letters of William Lloyd Garrison: From Disunionism to the Brink of War, 1850–1860</title>, ed. Louis Ruchames [Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1975], 4:415). Johnson, Tilton, and Garrison were united by a common profession as well as shared antislavery convictions. During the war each reprinted items from the other's newspapers.</p></note></note>
