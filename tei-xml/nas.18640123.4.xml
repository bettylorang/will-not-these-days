In 1859 he moved to New York and established the Third Unitarian Society (later the Independent Liberal Church); based in the city throughout the war, he ministered to an eclectic congregation united by strong reform impulses. He was one of the founding members of the National Freedmen's Relief Association of New York (est. February 22, 1862) and served as its corresponding secretary. He was later appointed to the Committee on Teachers and Publications (American Freedmen's Union Commission).</p><p>After the war, Frothingham cofounded and presided over the Free Religious Association (1867&#8211;1878). In addition to his religious discourses, he published <title level="m">Transcendentalism in New England: A History</title> (1876) and biographies of contemporary reformers&#8212;including that of his good friend Theodore Parker. These works established his reputation as one of Transcendentalism's earliest historians. See Susan M.

The town became "a magnet for most black refugees" (Richard M. Reid, <title level="j">Freedom for Themselves: North Carolina's Black Soldiers in the Civil War Era</title> [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008], 221), and camps were set up for those who could not find other accommodation. Henry Clapp's census of the freed black population of North Carolina, completed by March 1863, suggested there were no fewer than 8,500 black refugees in and near New Bern (13).
