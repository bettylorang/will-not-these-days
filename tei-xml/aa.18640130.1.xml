                <byline rend="center">BY FRANCES E. W. HARPER.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (1825&#8211;1911), activist, orator, and writer. Born Frances Ellen Watkins in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper was raised by her aunt and schoolmaster uncle after the death of her parents. She received a rigorous education at the Reverend William Watkins's Academy for Negro Youth and took part in antislavery activities with his family. In her midtwenties, she taught in Ohio and Pennsylvania. She pledged herself to the antislavery movement in response to the death of a free black man whom Maryland authorities had arrested and sent into slavery for the crime of entering the state. In 1854, she began to lecture for the Maine Anti-Slavery Society. Her <title level="m">Poems of Miscellaneous Subjects</title> appeared in the same year (the first of ten volumes of poetry published between 1854 and 1901). In November 1859 she championed militant abolitionist John Brown as "the hero of the nineteenth century" (William Still, <title level="m">The Underground Rail Road</title> [Philadelphia: Porter and Coates, 1872], 762).</p><p>Harper continued to lecture with great success until late 1860, when she married Fenton Harper, a widower with three children. The family moved to a farm in Grove City, Ohio, where Harper managed their domestic life and wrote for the antislavery press. The <title level="j">Christian Recorder</title> of September 27, 1862, printed her criticisms of Lincoln in late September 1862: "The President's dabbling with Colonization just now, suggests to my mind the idea of a man almost dying with a loathsome cancer, and busying himself about having his hair trimmed according to the latest fashion." The Emancipation Proclamation raised her hopes, and she returned to the platform to speak on "the President's Proclamation." "I know that all is not accomplished," she told William Still, "but we may rejoice in what has been already wrought,&#8212;the wondrous change in so short a time" (766). Her poems appeared in the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, the <title level="j">Free Nation</title>, and other newspapers. As "a form of public speech addressed to concrete, empirically identifiable others" (Paula Bernat Bennett, <title level="m">Poets in the Public Sphere: The Emancipatory Project of American Women's Poetry, 1800&#8212;1900</title> [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003], 5), these pieces represent a continuation of her mission as a lecturer. The newspaper served as another platform.</p><p>Fenton Harper's death precipitated a financial crisis in May 1864: the contents of the family home were seized by creditors. Harper returned to the lecture circuit and "turned her attention to Reconstruction, temperance, education, moral reform, and women's rights" (Shirley Wilson Logan, <title level="m">'We Are Coming': The Persuasive Discourse of Nineteenth-Century Black Women</title> [Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1999], 48). She and Edmonia Highgate were the only women to address the National Convention of Colored Men in the fall of 1864. After the war, she lectured throughout the South. Her first serialized novel, <title level="m">Minnie's Sacrifice</title>, appeared in 1869. After the publication of <title level="m">Iola Leroy; or, Shadows Uplifted</title> (1892), she helped found the National Association of Colored Women (1896).</p></note></byline>

                    <l><emph rend="smallcaps">Come</emph> closer to me, husband!<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>The stanzas describe a "good death" in the tradition of the <emph rend="italic">ars moriendi</emph>. In mid-nineteenth-century America, such a death required the bedside presence of family members and the utterance of precious last words, as well as the manifestation of signs of the dying person's salvation (Drew Gilpin Faust, <title level="m">This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War</title> [New York: Knopf, 2008], 10&#8211;11). These beliefs and conventions persisted during the Civil War, even as the distant deaths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers challenged established rituals of grief and mourning.</p><p>Convinced of an afterlife in heaven, Harper's mother provides consolation and instruction in her last moments; the lyric comprises a dramatic form of didactic devotional literature. Lines 11 and 12 ("Tell her she must <emph rend="itlaic">meet</emph> her mother / In the blessed world above") suggests that childbirth may have caused the speaker's death (emphasis added).</p></note></l>
