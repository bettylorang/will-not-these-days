Leaving the newspaper in his brother Thomas's experienced hands, he explored the area around Washington, DC, as well as Virginia and the coastal region of North Carolina. He sent the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> vivid letters describing the activities of the freedpeople, missionaries, and African American regiments. Throughout his tour, he sought new subscribers for the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> and promoted racial solidarity at meetings in churches and camps. Debra Jackson offers a full account of his activities in "A Black Journalist in Civil War Virginia: Robert Hamilton and the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title>," <title level="j">Virginia Magazine of History and Biography</title>, 116 (2008): 42&#8211;72. Thomas Hamilton announced his brother's homecoming on March 5, 1864. Before the year was out, the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> editor had embarked on a new tour of the West and Southwest. [Editors' note: The original version of this footnote gave Robert Hamilton's year of death as 1878. This typographical error was corrected on August 25, 2014.]</note></byline>

Grant (1822&#8211;1885), and William T. Sherman (1820&#8211;1891).</p><p> While in command at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, Benjamin Butler refused to return fugitive slaves to the enemy on the grounds that they were "contraband of war" (May 1861); his approach became War Department policy. During his military governorship of captured New Orleans, he determined to quash Confederate sympathies and&#8212;crucially, for Hamilton&#8212;raised Afro-Creole regiments of Louisiana Native Guards. In late 1863 he was given the command of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina.</p><p>Grant's daring Vicksburg campaigns resulted in the city's surrender on July 4, 1863; Lincoln, already a staunch supporter of the fighting general, pledged himself to Grant. After Grant's victory at Missionary Ridge (November 1863), Lincoln appointed him general in chief of all Union armies. In 1864 Grant put his plan for coordinated Union offensives into action.</p><p>Sherman worked closely with Grant. He contributed to the capture of Vicksburg in July 1863, and was appointed commander of the Department of the Army of the Tennessee in the fall. He began his controversial campaign against Southern civilians in February 1864; in March, he was made head of military operations in the West. By capturing Atlanta in September 1864, he revived Lincoln's election hopes.</p></note></l>

New Bern (or "Newbern") was occupied by Union forces in mid-March 1862 as part of General Ambrose Burnside's movement to gain control of North Carolina's coastal region. The town became "a magnet for most black refugees" (Richard M. Reid, <title level="j">Freedom for Themselves: North Carolina's Black Soldiers in the Civil War Era</title> [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008], 221), and camps were set up for those who could not find other accommodation. Henry Clapp's census of the freed black population of North Carolina, completed by March 1863, suggested there were no fewer than 8,500 black refugees in and near New Bern (13). Many of the men enlisted in United States Colored Troops regiments.</p><p>No less than three of Hamilton's tour letters appeared in the issue of the <title level="j">Anglo-African</title> that included "Our Country's Flag." In these articles, Hamilton introduced readers to New Bern and Washington. He described the activities of the towns' African American citizens and paid particular attention to their businesses, schools, and churches. The front page letter dated December 31 suggests that he used New Bern as a base between December 16, 1863, and January 1, 1864. New Year's Day would see the first anniversary of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation; in "A Trip to Washington, N.C." Hamilton reported that he had promised to speak at New Bern's Emancipation Day celebrations. Poetry and song played a crucial part in Hamilton's public discourse; "Our Country's Song" was almost certainly performed during the program.</p></note> Dec. 31, 1863.</dateline>
