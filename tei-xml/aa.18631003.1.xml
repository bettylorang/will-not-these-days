                <head type="main" subtype="authorial" rend="center">FATHER ABRAHAM'S PROCLAMATION.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>President Abraham Lincoln (1809&#8211;1865) issued his Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In it, he declared that "all persons held as slaves" in rebel states "are, and henceforward shall be free." He also pledged that "the Executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof," would "recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons" (Roy P. Basler, ed., <title level="m">The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</title> [New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953], 6:29&#8211;30). Although the proclamation did not touch slavery in loyal border states and exempted Union-occupied regions of the Louisiana and Virginia as well as Tennessee, abolitionists recognized and celebrated it as a great step forward.</p><p>The familiar name "Father Abraham" circulated widely in the latter half of the war. James Sloan Gibbons's popular recruiting song "We are Coming, Father Abraham, Three Hundred Thousand More" (1862) likened Lincoln to the biblical patriarch. "Father Abraham" at once paid tribute to Lincoln's leadership and affirmed a close connection defined by paternal care and familial loyalty. Historian Michael Burlingame notes the discourse of fatherhood in black and white responses to Lincoln's death (<title level="j">Abraham Lincoln: A Life</title> [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008], 2:829).</p></note></head>

                <head type="sub" subtype="authorial" rend="center">A SONG<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">The lyrics were probably set to the immensely popular tune of "John Brown's Body," described by Christian McWhirter as "the Union's national hymn" (<title level="m">Battle Hymns: The Power and Popularity of Music in the Civil War</title> [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2012], 41). Versions of the song&#8212;associated with abolitionist martyr Brown and his militant antislavery message&#8212;promoted African American enlistment. In addition to "Father Abraham's Proclamation," see <ref target="aa.18631010.4">"A War Song for the Black Volunteers"</ref> (<title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, October 10, 1863) and <ref target="aa.18640305.1">"Marching Song of the First Arkansas"</ref> (<title level="j">Anglo-African</title>, March 5, 1864).</note> FOR THE CONTRABANDS.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el">General Benjamin F. Butler, commander at Fortress Monroe, defined fugitive slaves as "contraband of war" in the summer of 1861. Labeled as rebel property, runaway slaves could be confiscated by Union troops; doing so would deprive the Confederate war effort of manpower and secure military laborers for federal commanders, without challenging slavery on legal grounds. Secretary of War Simon Cameron approved the policy, which was consolidated by the terms of the First Confiscation Act. See <title level="m">Freedom: A Documentary History of Emancipation, 1861&#8211;1867</title>, ed. Ira Berlin, et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), series 1, 1:15&#8211;16. Although the final Emancipation Proclamation transformed the legal status of many "contrabands," the term continued to circulate in the North.</note></head>
