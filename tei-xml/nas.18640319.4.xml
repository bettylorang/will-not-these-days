                <byline rend="center">BY FRANCES D. GAGE.<note type="editorial" resp="#bw #el"><p>By the time the war began, Ohioan Frances Dana Barker Gage (1808&#8211;1884) had established herself as a leading advocate of women's rights and abolition, in the reform press and on the platform. A laudatory biographical sketch in <title level="m">Eminent Women of the Age</title> (1868) describes how she found time "to read, and write for leading journals, and often to speak, too, on temperance, slavery, and woman's rights" while raising a family of eight ([Elizabeth Cady Stanton], "Frances D. Gage," in <title level="m">Eminent Women of the Age; Being Narratives of the Lives and Deeds of the Most Prominent Women of the Present Generation</title>, by James Parton, et al. [Hartford, CT: Betts, 1868], 383). Gage contributed to journals such as the <title level="j">Ladies' Repository</title>, the <title level="j">Ohio Cultivator</title>, the <title level="j">Lily: A Monthly Journal Devoted to Temperance and Literature</title>, the <title level="j">Saturday Visitor</title>, and the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>&#8212;a mixture of titles linked by her reform agendas and regional affiliations. In the early 1850s Gage also presided over a number of statewide and national women's rights conventions, including the Akron convention of 1851, where Sojourner Truth challenged the patriarchy and delegates' racial prejudices. Gage's recollections of Truth's speech were published in the <title level="j">Standard</title> halfway through the war (<title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, May 2, 1863, [4]).</p>
                    <p>In 1862 Gage and her daughter Mary joined the Northern mission to educate the freedpeople and prove the moral and economic superiority of free labor on South Carolina's Sea Islands. Gage stayed on Parris Island for over a year, without an official title or salary, as "supervisor" to approximately 500 freedmen, women, and children. During this period, she supplied the <title level="j">New York Independent</title> and the <title level="j">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title> with "South Carolina correspondence." She returned to the North in the winter of 1863 and embarked on a lecture tour to raise relief funds. Gage continued her war work as "an unsalaried agent of the Sanitary Commission" in Memphis, Vicksburg, and Natchez ([Stanton], "Frances D. Gage," 384&#8211;85).</p></note></byline>
